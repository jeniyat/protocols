Feather and skin are ideal tissues to explore the genomics and complexity of colour patterns in vertebrates. Two species of the genus Chrysolophus, golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) and Lady Amherst\u2019s pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), exhibit brilliant colours in their plumage, but with extreme phenotypic differences, making these two species great models to investigate plumage colouration mechanisms in birds. Here we provide details of the protocols used for plumage pigments identification by High-performance liquid chromatography.\u00a0The fat-soluble pigments (carotenoids) and oxidation products of melanins (TTCA and PTCA) can be qualitatively and quantificationally analyzed by HPLC with the corresponding standards, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"<p>The sample pretreatment process should be completed in
