In spite of large numbers of data records being available, however, the proportion of those records that is readily usable for science applications is quite small. The difference between the full number of data records existing\u00a0<em>versus\u00a0<\/em>the records that are ready for use is the result of what we call \"leakage\" of data, in the form of steps that have not been taken\u00a0or errors that remove the utility of the data. In this contribution, we explore several large-scale biodiversity data sets in terms of why they contain data records that are or are not ready for use.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8355","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1508724184","protocol_affiliation":"University of Kansas,University of Ghana,Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental,University of California at Berkeley","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kebctan","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2v234w2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/012.png","full_name":"A.

For the Brazilian Virtual Herbarium, names are from Brazilian Flora 2020 (http:\/\/floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br) and Catalogue of Life (http:\/\/www.catalogueoflife.org\/), in that order). We did not consider the potential for an expert to review and identify the specimen fully as rescuable, as that step would extend beyond the data to actual handling of the specimen, or at least detailed inspection of images by specialists.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Georeferencing Caveats<\/strong>:\u00a0We required that\u00a0georeferences demonstrate the characteristics of best practice, as outlined in the MaNIS georeferencing protocol.
