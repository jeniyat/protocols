This response can be captured by electromyography (EMG) and is called vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP). The VEMP triggered by GVS (galvanic-VEMP) assesses the central pathways of the vestibular system. When the EMG responses are recorded in the lower limbs, galvanic-VEMP provides information about the function of the vestibulospinal tract extending from the cervical to the lumbar spine. Galvanic-VEMP is a safe, low-cost, and easily performed test which has been used to investigate spinal cord function in cases of trauma, tumor, ischemia, and infection. Our research group has been using galvanic-VEMP to follow patients with diseases that cause postural disabilities, such as Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM), Schistosomal myeloradiculopathy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. This protocol aims at showing how to perform VEMP triggered by galvanic vestibular stimulation with the EMG responses being recorded in the lower limbs.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"10947","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1521506695","protocol_affiliation":"Federal University of  Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil,Catholic University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.nxbdfin","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2z2a423x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ux9i9kw.jpg","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/uxbi9kw.jpg","full_name":"Ludimila Labanca","created_by":"Ludimila Labanca","private_link":"F96044A89E10AA4DD5828DA3D76E9122","original_img":"1","username":"ludimila-labanca","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":291607,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential, galvanic vestibular stimulation, lower limbs, diagnosis, spinal cord","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"big_protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ux8i9kw.jpg","big_protocol_img_ofn":"capa.jpg","is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Ludimila Labanca,J\u00falia Fonseca de Morais Caporali,Maur\u00edcio Campelo Tavares,Denise Utsch Gon\u00e7alves","authors_list":[{"name":"Ludimila Labanca","affiliation":"Federal University of  Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"J\u00falia Fonseca de Morais Caporali","affiliation":"Federal University of  Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Maur\u00edcio Campelo Tavares","affiliation":"Catholic University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Denise Utsch Gon\u00e7alves","affiliation":"Federal University of  Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/uxbi9kw.jpg","username":"ludimila-labanca","full_name":"Ludimila Labanca","created_by":"Ludimila Labanca"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"615657","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"2F2B11F37F4A478A965B84143ED313CE","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1521765248","components":[{"component_id":"1074802","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"478F0AF97FE04DA8BC5FD2DCDE88D26B","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Equipment \/ Software","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Equipment \/ Software"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1074801","previous_id":"1074802","original_id":"0","guid":"EA3890E5AB424B96A81A268CFC1EDF71","previous_guid":"478F0AF97FE04DA8BC5FD2DCDE88D26B","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>This protocol uses the EvP4\/ATCPlus model (Contronic Ltd., Pelotas, Brazil) connected to a laptop.

For each test, four trials of 15 stimuli (Table 1) are applied and distributed, resulting in 30 responses recorded on the left lower limb (15 CLAR and 15 CRAL stimuli) and 30 responses recorded on the right lower limb (15 CLAR and 15 CRAL stimuli). The galvanic-VEMP is firstly measured on the left leg and after on the right leg (Table 1). This procedure must be repeated for each leg to ensure data replication. It is necessary a 2-min resting interval (approximately), between the examination of each leg, to avoid muscle fatigue.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Table 1.<\/strong>\u00a0Polarity configuration of the stimuli and corresponding leg for capturing responses during vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) triggered by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 675px; height: 242px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 439px; text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Polarity configuration of the stimuli<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 220px; text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Local Response <\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 439px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>cathode left and anode right (CLAR)<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 220px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>Left leg<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 439px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>cathode right and anode left(CRAL)<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 220px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>Left leg<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 439px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>cathode left and anode right (CLAR)<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 220px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>Right leg<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 439px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>cathode right and anode left(CRAL)<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 220px; text-align: center;\">\n<p>Right leg<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"615664","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"0693E7F414D54C4DA7C02D55C845BE45","previous_guid":"5CD9B4FBE56A4EF1B090C3E4B879062C","previous_id":"615663","last_modified":"1521509351","components":[{"component_id":"1074816","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"A5876D8F45084D18B46905D18B2926E9","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data of acquisition","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data of acquisition"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1074815","previous_id":"1074816","original_id":"0","guid":"1FE8F0AF3CB74006BDE7AEE9B0EFE972","previous_guid":"A5876D8F45084D18B46905D18B2926E9","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>The amplifier input impedance is 10 MOhm, differential.
