In 2018, 50 mL high-purity helium was used instead. Choice of the volume and type of headspace gas depends on the application. My primary objective was to obtain large quantities of CH4 for advanced isotopologue analyses, which is why I used relatively large headspace volumes. Larger headspaces require longer equilibration times and\/or higher flow rates. I do not report N2, O2, Ar, CO2, or He measurements on these samples, so the choice of headspace gas (air\/He\/N2, and their potential to contaminate the sample if equilibration was not fully obtained) is irrelevant. I used dissolved inorganic carbon analyses on water samples, in addition to pH measurements, to quantify pCO2. I observed good correlation between the dissolved inorganic carbon analyses and CO2 measured on bubble strip gas samples, indicating that water\/gas equilibrium was obtained, or closely approached.<\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":"","username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"research_interests":null},"comments":[]}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":742887,"guid":"D58B9AD0782511E98A60F76E0B0B4B0D","previous_id":742886,"previous_guid":"231591D0782511E98A60F76E0B0B4B0D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"E9C5C73CCA95448AA60155C65920DECD","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F881B73B25D94C3E8187980D81E55FEE","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Attach syringe to sampling port on bottle cap.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":742889,"guid":"EA852C30782511E98A60F76E0B0B4B0D","previous_id":742887,"previous_guid":"D58B9AD0782511E98A60F76E0B0B4B0D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"8DBAF76ADB5D4F1B9097EBB053706C6A","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"CD5B4BB9785A4286967580EDC9C3EA4D","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Inject 60 mL air through the sampling port into the glass bottle.
