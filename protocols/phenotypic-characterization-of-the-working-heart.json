Mice are heparinized by intraperitoneal injection of 200\u03bcl of heparin (1000USP units\/ml) and then subjected to deep anesthesia by injecting chloral hydrate at a dose of 0.7mg\/g body weight. The hearts are then removed from the mouse, dissected and trimmed of fat and extraneous pulmonary tissue. The aorta is cannulated first using an 18G steel cannula and the heart is initially perfused in the retrograde mode with Krebs Henseleit Buffer (KHB). The pulmonary vein is then cannulated and the perfusate flow reversed so that buffer enters the left side of the heart via the pulmonary vein and is ejected via the aorta. Details of these protocols have been extensively described in the literature (1-6).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>The working heart buffer is KHB containing (in mM) (118.5 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">\u00b3<\/span><span>, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">4<\/span><span>, 1.2 KH<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">\u00b2<\/span><span>PO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">4<\/span><span>, 2.5 CaCl<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">\u00b2<\/span><span>, 0.5 EDTA, (5 or 11) glucose and gassed with 95% O<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">\u00b2<\/span><span>-5% CO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">\u00b2<\/span><span>, supplemented with (0.4, 1.0 or 1.2) mM palmitate bound to 3% BSA and 5 or 11 mM glucose. The final concentrations of palmitate and glucose are determined by the specific model that is being evaluated. For example in studies of db\/db mice, hearts are perfused at 11mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate as these concentrations more closely reflect the in vivo milieu of the animals. In contrast, in animals with cardiac restricted changes in gene expression in which systemic concentrations of glucose and fatty acids are normal, hearts are perfused with 5mM glucose and 0.4 mM palmitate. Hearts are also perfused in the presence or absence of 1nM insulin, which measures the degree of insulin responsiveness of the perfused hearts. For determination of metabolism; rates of glycolysis for exogenous glucose, glucose oxidation, and palmitate oxidation are measured over a 60-min period. Hearts are perfused at a preload of 15 mmHg and aortic pressures and cardiac performance determined as described in (1-6).<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Throughout the 60-min perfusion, pressure and flow measurements are obtained every 10-min. At 20-min intervals (starting at 0 min), a 2.5-ml sample of buffer is withdrawn for determinations of metabolite content. All determinations of substrate metabolism for each time point are made in duplicate. At the end of the experiment, the hearts are quickly frozen between metal blocks cooled to -80\u00b0C, rapidly weighed, and stored at - 80\u00b0C. Hearts are subsequently pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. A sample of heart tissue (~20 mg) is also weighed (wet wt), and then dried to constant weight (dry wt). The ratio of this sample (dry-to-wet wt) is used to calculate the total dry mass of the heart.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>Glycolysis and glucose oxidation are measured simultaneously in one set of hearts, while palmitate oxidation is measured in a separate set of hearts.
