Remove the animal from its cage, holding it with one hand by the tail. Still holding the tail, place the animal on a flat surface. (If it feels more comfortable, place a small cloth over the animal, particularly covering the eyes and mouth area to calm the animal and avoid any biting.) With the other hand, gently but firmly grab the animal by the extra skin on the back of the neck just below the ears to immobilize it. Turn the animal ventral side up and inject the anesthesia into the peritoneal cavity (between the abdominal midline and the leg) at an angle of  30\u00b0(Fig. 3). Do this procedure as quickly as possible to minimize stress and discomfort for the animal.

Following the first dose of anesthesia, the majority of gross motor behavior should cease with around 5-10 minutes. The animal can then be removed from the cage and laid out on the dissection tray (but not restrained). Additional doses of anesthesia can be applied as needed. The animal is considered to be deeply anesthetized when motor behavior has ceased, respiratory rhythm is slow and regular, and the animal does not show any reflex responses to noxious stimuli. Only after deep anesthesia is verified is the animal restrained on the dissection tray and the procedure can begin.<\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"54B0C2E086AF4AEA850B4D42FE068EAF","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/betya.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null},{"id":723968,"guid":"E16067104CAF11E98D4BB1225277FBFE","previous_id":723966,"previous_guid":"1F59AFF04CAF11E98D4BB1225277FBFE","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"9F3BC166ECC0471DB882B31850F574B6","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Dissection"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"9445D9A2D03D442BB22043CBD243D7D0","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Position and restrain the animal for dissection:<\/span><span> Once the animal is completely anesthetized, position it ventral side up in the dissecting tray and fix each of the limbs to the tray with masking tape (Fig. 4).<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/betza.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"117D199388E54EB8B353BD93A44CD604","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/betza.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null},{"id":723971,"guid":"6D6521104CB011E98D4BB1225277FBFE","previous_id":723968,"previous_guid":"E16067104CAF11E98D4BB1225277FBFE","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"B9703358AAD94D8584C60A9B1553FA78","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Dissection"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"9CF25749B59B429C82D739CC9DC48C79","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Expose the thoracic wall:<\/span><span> Use the hemostatic forceps to clamp and pull up on the fur and skin in the center of the thorax (Fig. 5A).

Place the tube running from the gas tank into the dish to oxygenate the brain. Set the Vibratome to cut brain slices 200-300 microns thick at the lowest velocity and power. After each slice is cut, move the blade up 50 microns and return it to its original position; this ensures the blade will not touch the brain as it moves backwards. Once in its original position, move the blade back down 50 microns and then down the additional 200-300 microns to cut the next slice. Repeat this process until most of the brain tissue has been sliced. While some slices may fragment, this procedure should result in 6-7 good quality sagital slices from each brain hemisphere (Fig. 15B).<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/beug6rv.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"89F0BC2E00FD4B60B8C548BDA7C3E451","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :;

In particular, our research group is interested in obtaining patch clamp recordings from neurons in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampal formation to investigate how the excitability of neurons change during development and aging. To carry out these experiments, we must first dissect out the brain and obtain slices, all while keeping the brain healthy so that the neurons survive and can later be recorded. Here we outline our procedures for anesthetizing, perfusing, dissecting out the brain, and finally obtaining slices. This protocol can also be used as a teaching tool to train students in the handling and dissection of rodents, and the preparation of brain tissue. The slices obtained can also be used for neuroanatomical studies or in training students to identify different brain structures. Our goals in sharing this protocol are to be transparent about our scientific methodology and to help other researchers performing similar experiments.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Funding: This work was supported by a grant from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Direcci\u00f3n General de Asuntos del Personal Acad\u00e9mico, Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigaci\u00f3n e Innovaci\u00f3n Tecnol\u00f3gica <\/span><span><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT IA209817 to Erin C.
