Handovers sessions periodically happen to transfer professional responsibility for some or all care for a patient between physicians and\/or professional group [2]. The implementation of the electronic handover has the challenge to ensure this dynamism, enabling the safe updating of information on care and patient-related behaviors [3]. Electronic approaches have been described to overcome the deficits of variable and unstructured forms of clinical handover [4]. Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a longitudinal health record with entries by healthcare practitioners in multiple sites where care is provided [5]. Such essential properties of the registry are supposed to provide prompt and reliable information for authorized users of electronic systems, supporting decisions and offering alerts for critical conditions [6].

Effective communication during the transfer of care is critical to foster the continuity of medical assistance and patient safety. In this opportunity, Electronic Health Records (EHR) has the potential to provide prompt and reliable information for authorized users of electronic systems, supporting decisions and offering alerts for critical conditions. <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objective: <\/span><span>To report a study protocol to evaluate the impact of an electronic handover implementation that supports the information transference of care, during doctors shifts sessions.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods:<\/span><span> Research protocol for connected interface implementation, single-group clinical trial to compare data-quality outcomes pre-post implementation of the intervention. A a random sample of handover sessions will be selected to assess the impact of the intervention. During the predeployment step, paper-based handover formularies will be recollected and analyzed. The priorities of health information transfer during handover, as well as its legal and security aspects will be used to add requirements to the novel system of communication. The handover system, integrated with the existent electronic medical record, will be developed according to the best clinical practice in care transference and obstetric protocols based on evidence. After EHR implementation, an after-before analysis will assess the impact of the invention. Primary outcomes are the quality of information registered in the medical handover record and data security, namely authenticity and traceability. As a secondary outcome, the duration of the transfer of care an external observer using a chronometer will evaluate sessions.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Results:<\/span><span> The study began in March 2018 with the training of the researchers to collect data during handover sessions. The first in loco evaluation of a handover session occurred: 2018-04-20.\u2028Planned date for the post-deployment evaluation is: 2019-08-31.\u2028Data analysis will be finalized and the final results are expected for December \/ 2019.
