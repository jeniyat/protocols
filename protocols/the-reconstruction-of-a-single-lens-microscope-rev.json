The A. van Leeuwenhoek\u2019s microscope is a deceptively simple device that contains a single spherical lens housed in a metal plate, an specimen pin, where a capillary glass that contains the sample dissolved in water is inserted, and a series of associated screws that allow to position the capillary in the focal distance for the observation of the sample. Thus, we present the following protocol that includes the steps to elaborate an spherical lens of great power of magnification, and the steps to make simple tissue samples for visualization. The following protocol aims to show a simple, easily accessible, low cost, and effective, for the observation of microscopic samples, possible to perform anywhere, without depending on a laboratory or complex tools for its development.<\/div><\/div>"}
