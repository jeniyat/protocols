Animals are anesthetized with isoflurane (3% in 70% nitrous oxide\/30% oxygen) in an induction chamber. The absence of a toe pinch reflex is used to determine a proper level of anesthesia. The mouse is then placed on the surgical bench and the nose is positioned in a nosecone to maintain a proper level of anesthesia using approximately 1.5% isoflurane in 70% nitrous oxide\/30% oxygen. The neck is shaved and scrubbed with a 10% betadine solution, followed by a rinse with 70% ETOH, and the area is painted with 10% betadine. A local injection of Bupivacaine (5mg\/kg) is made prior to making a small incision in the neck to expose the right carotid artery. Once exposed, the artery is double-ligated with 3-O surgical silk and the incision is sutured twice using Nylon monofilament suture. The animal is allowed to recover in his cage with access to food and water for 3 hours. Surgical instruments are placed in a Germinator 500 glass bead sterilizer for sterilization in between surgeries.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Following the 3h recovery from surgery, the mice are exposed to a predetermined hypoxic\/ ischemic insult using 9% oxygen balance N2. Each mouse is placed in an individual 500ml glass jar within a closed system in a circulating water bath maintained at 35.5\u00baC. The water bath contains Bacdown as a disinfectant. Upon completion of the H\/I insult, the mice are returned to their cages and monitored prior to being returned to the vent rack for the established period of recovery time. Mice are housed in pairs and are supplemented with 5% glucose in the drinking water. Food pellets are placed in the bottom of the cages for easy access, and a nestlet is provided for enrichment.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">At the time of sacrifice, each mouse is placed in a restrainer. A 25GA needle is used to prick the tail, and 5ul of blood is collected into a glucometer cuvette to measure glucose levels. The mouse is then anesthetized with an IP injection cocktail consisting of 80-100mg\/kg ketamine and 10mg\/kg xylazine. A surgical plane of anesthesia is confirmed by the absence of a toe pinch reflex prior to immobilizing the mouse on a flat surface. An incision is made in the lower abdomen and continues up to the xyphoid process. At the xyphoid, lateral incisions are made up towards the left arm and right arm near the neck. The rib cage is clamped back over the head, keeping it parallel with the torso. The descending aorta is snipped below the diaphragm to obtain serum or plasma, and the blood is collected into an appropriate tubes. A small incision is made in the left ventricle of the heart and a feeding tube is inserted up towards the ascending aorta so as the bulb sits directly beneath the junction of the aorta and heart. The aorta and feeding tube are clamped below the bulb of the feeding tube, and a small incision is made in the right atrium to begin perfusion. The mouse is perfused with 30ml of 1x PBS at a rate of 3.3cc\/min.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Upon completion of the perfusion, the brain is removed from the skull and lowly immersed in isopentane maintained at 38\u00baC on dry ice. Once bubbling subsides, the brain is wrapped in a labeled piece of foil and stored on dry ice until the completion of the experiment and subsequently stored at -80\u00baC until cryosectioned. (Alternatively the fresh brain can be placed in a brain mold for TTC staining. See below.)16 \u03bcm Sections from fresh frozen or perfused flushed brains are placed on superfrost plus slides in a consecutive manner, such that two slides represent the entire areas of interest that includes the caudate putamen, cortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus.

The plate is wrapped in foil and placed on a 37\u00b0C slide warmer for 30 minutes. TTC is removed and 500ul of fixative is added to each well for storage.
