You should receive your sequencing results as a trace file (.ab1) which graphically depicts the sequence as a series of colored peaks corresponding to one of the four nucleotide bases. This is an example of a trace file from a high-quality portion of a sequencing reaction:<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/media.addgene.org\/data\/easy-thumbnails\/filer_public\/cms\/filer_public\/4d\/f8\/4df8a318-6c00-4465-a2ba-83e5541460f8\/clean_sequence.jpg__260x128_q85_subsampling-2_upscale.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sequence near the beginning or end of a sequencing reaction is often unreliable. Although your sequencing results may indicate bases at specific locations, by looking at the trace file, you will see that these base calls are unreliable.
