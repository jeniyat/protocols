Fibrinogen levels were determined with an ACL-9000 (Diamond Diagnostics, Holliston, MA) coagulation analyser, using a PT-fibrinogen high sensitivity reagent, which is a high-sensitivity calcium thromboplastin that allows the simultaneous determination of PT and fibrinogen levels. aPTT was measured using an ACL-9000 coagulation analyser and INR was calculated by the formula INR (PT patient\/PT normal).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8510","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1509541777","protocol_affiliation":"Department
