Many earlier estimates of viral abundance have been made on preserved samples; however, several studies have shown rapid and significant decay of viral particles in aldehyde-fixed samples (Brussaard 2004; Danovaro et al. 2001; Wen et al. 2004), although there is evidence that the decay is lessened when larger-volume samples are preserved (Patel et al. 2007). Samples preserved in the field should be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Even freezing with dry ice (frozen CO<sub>2<\/sub>) or immediately freezing in a \u201387\u00b0C freezer is not adequate for preservation, and to our knowledge, freezing in a dry ice\/ethanol slurry (\u201378\u00b0C) has not been tested. Samples to be preserved should be fixed in 0.5% (final concentration) EM-grade glutaraldehyde and flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2<\/sub>. For relatively productive samples with virus abundances \u226510<sup>6<\/sup> mL<sup>\u20131<\/sup>, add 30 \u00b5L of 25% EM-grade glutaraldehyde into prelabeled 2-mL cryovials, add 1470 \u00b5L of the sample to be counted, and mix. These volumes can be halved for samples with virus abundances \u226510<sup>7<\/sup> mL<sup>\u20131<\/sup> and increased to 4 mL in 5-mL cryovials for very oligotrophic samples. Allow the samples to stand for at least 15 min but no longer than 30 min, and then freeze immediately in liquid N<sub>2<\/sub>. To facilitate easy retrieval, vials can be placed in women\u2019s nylon stockings before freezing. (We find black sheer ones the most aesthetically pleasing.) Once frozen, the vials can be transferred to \u201380\u00b0C for long-term storage, until the slides can be prepared. For counting, the frozen samples are thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath and immediately stained with SYBR Green I or SYBR Gold, as outlined.<br \/><br \/>In the field, if it is impossible to make slides or preserve in liquid N, then it probably is best to collect the samples in as large volumes as is practical and maintain them under in situ conditions for as short a time as is possible until slides can be made.","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"131502","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"CF21791E2ACB4699949218967D13C1FE","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1446607723","components":[{"component_id":"127121","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"7ACA2FC9A2634148A6F43A46DE5A4A4F","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"Collect
