Take care to ensure all rectangles\u00a0are of equal dimensions. Note: Analysis requires identifying bands one channel at a time, although both channel analyses may be shown simultaneously once completed. Remember after quantitation to save final images, thereby providing a record of pixel numbers for each band.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ru9g3zw.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ru8g3zw.jpg\" data-ofn=\"i4_quant_d_red.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rvbg3zw.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rvag3zw.jpg\" data-ofn=\"i4_quant_d_grn.jpg\" \/><\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"600966","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"071EFF7C24EF44049AB3A615560726BD","previous_guid":"ED3B87D39AAD436E92812B724FB0757A","previous_id":"600139","last_modified":"1514665881","components":[{"component_id":"1037602","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"F634B777A46743939C2903B1F2041A75","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Infrared fluorescence quantitation ","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Infrared fluorescence quantitation "},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1037601","previous_id":"1037602","original_id":"0","guid":"CD216E1525E047ABAEB733FF0D0EF01E","previous_guid":"F634B777A46743939C2903B1F2041A75","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>(5) Once the full complement of bands has been identified, click on Show:Quantification\u00a0to obtain the pixel numbers for each quantitated band.
