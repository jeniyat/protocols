Single-molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH)\u2014an approach where individual RNAs are labeled with fluorescent probes and imaged in their native cellular and tissue context\u2014provides both the copy number and spatial context of RNAs but has been limited in the number of RNA species that can be measured simultaneously. Here we describe Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH), a massively parallelized form of smFISH that can image and identify hundreds to thousands of different RNA species simultaneously with high accuracy in individual cells in their native spatial context. We provide detailed protocols on all aspects of MERFISH, including probe design, data collection, and data analysis to allow interested laboratories to perform MERFISH measurements themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>smFISH is a powerful technique because it allows the quantitative measurement of the exact copy number and spatial distribution of individual mRNAs within single cells in intact tissues. MERFISH extends these powerful abilities to the transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing smFISH measurements by encoding individual RNA species with error-robust barcodes and reading out the barcodes via a series of smFISH measurements. We anticipate this method to be relatively easily adopted by other laboratories and the techniques described in this\u00a0collection should facilitate these efforts as will the supporting protocols and code that can be found at:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/zhuang.harvard.edu\/merfish\/ \" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/zhuang.harvard.edu\/merfish\/<\/a>.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9391","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1514384596","protocol_affiliation":"Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138 USA","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mepc3dn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2v274y2s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ruhfw26.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Max Brown","created_by":"Max Brown","private_link":"A3308E009FB8A140D315D2716E298321","original_img":"1","username":"max-brown","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p><strong>Jeffrey R.

In our current implementation of MERFISH, each oligonucleotide encoding probe consists of three basic components as illustrated in Figure 2. The first region is a 30-nt targeting region that is complementary to a portion of the sequence of the RNA to which it is designed to bind. The second region is a set of sequences that are called readout sequences, which were designed to be complementary and hence only bind to MERFISH readout probes and not other nucleic acid in the cell. Finally, the third region is a set of priming regions used in the construction of these probes, which will be discussed in detail in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/rna-imaging-with-merfish-probe-construction-meqc3dw\" target=\"_blank\">Probe Construction<\/a>.

The sheer number of unique sequences makes traditional solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis prohibitively expensive in most cases. For example, assuming a modest cost of $0.10\/base, an encoding probe length of ~100 nt, and the need for ~50,000 unique oligos for a single MERFISH measurement, the cost of the needed oligos would be $500,000! To circumvent this astronomical cost, we have developed a high-throughput approach to generating these probes which utilizes array-derived synthesis of complex oligonucleotide pools. These arrayderived complex oligonucleotide pools that contain ~100,000 custom designed sequences can be purchased for only a few thousand dollars. The challenge to using these pools is that each individual sequence is provided in quantities far too small to be used directly for labeling. Thus, we developed an enzymatic amplification protocol to generate the encoding probes in high quantity sufficient for RNA FISH experiments using the array-derived complex oligonucleotide pools as templates.<\/p>","public":"1","created_on":"1514392483","first_published_date":"2018-03-29 09:54:36","authors":"Jeffrey R.

First, fluorescent spots must be identified in all images. Second, slight changes in the stage position between images of the same region from different hybridization rounds must be corrected. Finally, sets of fluorescent spots that occupy the same location in the sample must be decoded into binary barcodes, which, in turn, are decoded into the specific RNA species. After these RNAs have been decoded, there are a series of simple calculations that can often be performed on the measured barcodes to determine important parameters associated with the performance of the measurements, such as estimates of the binary errors made at each bit or the relative confidence that can be ascribed to the counts for each RNA species.
