The barrier of the PAP PEN retains antisera within the defined area and ensures that only the amount of antibody needed for sufficient reaction is used.<\/li>\n<li>Block in 5% normal serum with 2% BSA in PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 (block solution) for 4 hours at room temperature.<\/li>\n<li>Drain slides for a few seconds (do not rinse)<\/li>\n<li>Wash the slides 1 x 15 minutes in PBS with gentle agitation.<\/li>\n<li>Wipe away excess liquid around the section on the glass slide with tissue\u00a0paper.<\/li>\n<li>Apply primary antibody diluted in block solution<\/li>\n<li>Incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Day 2<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drain slides for a few seconds (do not rinse)<\/li>\n<li>Wash the slides 2 x 15 minutes in PBS 0.05% Tween 20 with gentle agitation<\/li>\n<li>Wash the slides 1 x 15 minutes in PBS with gentle agitation<\/li>\n<li>Wipe away excess liquid around the section on the glass slide with tissue\u00a0paper.<\/li>\n<li>Apply fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody to the slide diluted to the concentration recommended by the manufacturer in block solution, and incubate for 2 hours at room temperature.

The antibody directed to the irrelevant antigen is known as the isotype control. For whole serum antibodies, use normal serum from an unimmunized animal of the same species as the primary antibody. If an isotype control is not available, a negative antibody control is recommended. Simply replace the primary antibody with antibody diluent. A positive tissue control is strongly recommended to ensure that the antibody is performing as expected. Depending on the experiment, it may also be useful to include a negative tissue control: a tissue in which the protein of interest is not expected to be found.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>References<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.abcam.com\/technical\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.abcam.com\/technical<\/a><\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"11629","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1524141318","protocol_affiliation":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.pkmdku6","doi_status":"0","changed_fork_steps":"","profile_url":"y22344y2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","full_name":"Chyntia D\u00edaz","created_by":"Chyntia D\u00edaz","private_link":"75AA2B805D18264CDC1681A6DEDC6278","original_img":"1","username":"chyntia-daz","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":306368,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"immunohistochemistry, frozen sections","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[{"tag_id":"1552","tag_name":"immunohistochemistry"}],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Melissa Pontes Pereira,Mar\u00eda Cristina Vidal Pessolani","authors_list":[{"name":"Melissa Pontes Pereira","affiliation":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Mar\u00eda Cristina Vidal Pessolani","affiliation":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","username":"chyntia-daz","full_name":"Chyntia D\u00edaz","created_by":"Chyntia D\u00edaz"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[]}
