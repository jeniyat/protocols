In fact, the\u00a0jet devices' water jet performances can be evaluated by\u00a0the striking force and the oil shale breaking effect of the high-pressure water jet produced by itself.\u00a0Under the same experimental conditions, the greater the striking force or the oil shale breaking effect more significant, the better the water jet performance of the\u00a0jet device. Moreover, the experiment of breaking oil shale can also\u00a0be used for proposing the\u00a0parameters of the borehole hydraulic mining for oil shale.\u00a0Therefore, the main aim of the experiments are\u00a0to compare\u00a0the striking forces and the breaking oil shale effects\u00a0with the different jet devices.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>Before starting, it is necessary to prepare the suitable labratory, self-developed multifunctional experimental device, jet devices, and oil shale samples in advance.
