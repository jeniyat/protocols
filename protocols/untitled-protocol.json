Make sure that cells are greater than 90%confluent and vary DNA (\u03bcg): Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (\u03bcl) ratios from 1:0.5 to 1:5.Scaling Up or Down TransfectionsTo transfect cells in different tissue culture formats, vary the amounts ofLipofectamine\u2122 2000, nucleic acid, cells, and medium used in proportion to therelative surface area, as shown in the table. With automated, high-throughputsystems, a complexing volume of 50 \u03bcl is recommended for transfections in 96-well plates. Note: You may perform rapid 96-well plate transfections by platingcells directly into the transfection mix. Prepare complexes in the plate anddirectly add cells at twice the cell density as in the basic protocol in a 100 \u03bclvolume.

Make sure that cells are greater than 90%confluent and vary DNA (\u03bcg): Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (\u03bcl) ratios from 1:0.5 to 1:5.Scaling Up or Down TransfectionsTo transfect cells in different tissue culture formats, vary the amounts ofLipofectamine\u2122 2000, nucleic acid, cells, and medium used in proportion to therelative surface area, as shown in the table. With automated, high-throughputsystems, a complexing volume of 50 \u03bcl is recommended for transfections in 96-well plates.
