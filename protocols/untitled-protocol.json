diaphragm skeletal muscle preparation, male Swiss mice of 90 to 120 days old were euthanized by cervical dislocation, the hemi-diaphragms were dissected and removed, before the washing with Tyrode nutrient solution (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2<\/sub>.6 H<sub>2<\/sub>O, 15 mM NaHCO<sub>3<\/sub>, 2 mM NaH<sub>2<\/sub>PO<sub>4<\/sub> H<sub>2<\/sub>O, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2<\/sub>.2 H<sub>2<\/sub>O, 11 mM D-glucose in distilled water, pH 7.4), and mounting accordingly to previously described by Duarte et al<em>.<\/em> [25]. Briefly, each hemi-diaphragm segment was transferred to an organ bath filled with 5 mL of Tyrode\u2019s solution at 37\u00baC, and the dissected tissue was tied up to a holder fixed at the bottom of the glass organ bath, while the upper extremity of the tissue was fixed to a force transducer, adjusted to impose an optimal tension (<em>i.e.<\/em> a condition in which the maximum contraction of each skeletal muscle preparation is observed). The contraction of the diaphragm muscle was induced by transmural electrical stimuli conducted through the platinum electrodes, at a frequency of 0.1 Hz and under supramaximal voltage, with duration of 2 ms each. After 30 min of stabilization of contraction amplitudes, to avoid the interference of acetylcholine released from the presynaptic terminals, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist <em>d<\/em>-tubocurarine (1 \u03bcM) was added to the preparations. After further 30 min of stabilization of contraction amplitudes now in the presence of <em>d<\/em>-tubocurarine, the tension of the preparation was rearranged. The influence of crotamine on the isometric twitch contraction was evaluated after confirming the stabilization of contraction amplitude for additional one hour and half, followed or not by the addition of K<sup>+<\/sup> ion channel blockers [26], one hour before the end of experiment, as schematically demonstrated in the graphic
