One of the characteristic features of yawning is its timing, with a gradual acceleration followed by an abrupt deceleration of the facial actions involved. Yawning usually emerges from a relaxed face, initially involving mouth stretching widely open (AUs 25 + 27) and upper eyelids drooping (AU 43).Although the specific AUs accompanying yawns vary, at apex they may include tightly closed eyelids (AUs 6+7+43), flattened tongue shape (AU 76b), and swallowing (AU 80). During the plateau, brow knitting (AU 3), brow knotting (AU 4), nose wrinkling (AU 9), lateral lip stretching (AU 20), nostril dilatation (AU 38) and head tilting back (AU 53) may occur. In this phase, the expansion of the pharynx can quadruple its diameter, while the larynx opens up with maximal abduction of the vocal cords [21]. Yawning is often accompanied by limb stretching and other bodily movements.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The SCPB is a recently developed coding scheme based on frame-by-frame analysis of video-recorded material. The system focuses on fetuses, preterm and full-term neonates and aims to identify and reliably code the repertoire of complex patterns of behaviors observable from the last trimester of pregnancy to the first month of age. The SCPB is a system based on the Action Units (AUs), Action Descriptors (ADs), Miscellaneous Actions and Supplementary Codes described in Baby FACS for identifying discrete facial muscle actions and more complex, configurationally defined patterns of facial behaviors.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":824330,"guid":"367CCA50EB5B11E9AF46DF61A3C2C555","previous_id":824319,"previous_guid":"CA248B00EB5911E9AF46DF61A3C2C555","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"DD7FDBF52EDF4EBE8C3FA7F837D94D95","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Inter-rater reliability"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"26F672C61C644213BF207D1F07AA6008","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Cohen\u2019s Kappa was used to assess inter-rater reliability between the primary and secondary coders.
