The AG-LFE recorded more total steps (13,723\u00b14,983 steps\/d) compared to AG-N and NL-800 (6,172\u00b12,838 and 5,817\u00b13,037 steps\/d, respectively; <em>p<\/em>&lt;0.001).\u00a0 Compared to the AG-N, the AG-LFE estimated less time in sedentary behaviors (518.7\u00b192.1 vs. 504.2\u00b1105.4 min\/d, respectively; <em>p<\/em>&lt;0.001), and more time in light (247.7\u00b170.4 vs. 279.1\u00b174.7 min\/d, respectively; <em>p<\/em>&lt;0.001) and MVPA (18.9\u00b116.9 vs. 21.5\u00b118.2 min\/d, respectively; <em>p<\/em>&lt;0.001), respectively.
