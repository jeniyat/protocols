Add the first enzyme and incubate at the desired temperature. Then, heat inactivate the first enzyme, add the second enzyme and incubate at the recommended temperature.&nbsp;<br \/>Depending on an enzyme's activity rating in a non-optimal NEBuffer, the number of units or incubation time may be adjusted to compensate for the slower rate of cleavage.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><strong>Setting up a Double Digestion with a Unique Buffer (designated &ldquo;U&rdquo;)&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>NEB currently supplies three enzymes with unique buffers:&nbsp;<a href='https:\/\/www.neb.com\/products\/r0101-ecori'>EcoRI<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href='https:\/\/www.neb.com\/products\/r0132-sspi'>SspI<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https:\/\/www.neb.com\/products\/r0543-dpnii'>DpnII<\/a>.
