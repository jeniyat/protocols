With the exception of phospholipid-hydroperoxide GPx, a monomer, all of the GPx enzymes are tetramers of four identical subunits. Each subunit contains a selenocysteine in the active site which participates directly in the two-electron reduction of the peroxide substrate. The enzyme uses glutathione as the ultimate electron donor to regenerate the reduced form of the selenocysteine. The Cayman Chemical Glutathione Peroxidase Assay Kit measures GPx activity indirectly by a coupled reaction with glutathione reductase (GR). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG), produced upon reduction of an organic hydroperoxide by GPx, is recycled to its reduced state by GR and NADPH. The oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The rate of decrease in the A340 is directly proportional to the GPx activity in the sample. The Cayman GPx Assay Kit can be used to measure all of the glutathione- dependent peroxidases in plasma, erythrocyte lysates, tissue homogenates, and cell lysates.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557848855}
