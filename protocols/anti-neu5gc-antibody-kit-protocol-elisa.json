Essentially, the glycoconjugate to be evaluated is immobilized on an ELISA plate and exposed to a primary antibody. The antibody provided in this kit has been shown to identify as little as 5pmol of Neu5Gc per microgram glycoprotein, which is at or below the current detection limit for conventional DMB HPLC analysis. An advantage of the ELISA procedure is that it confirms the presence of Neu5Gc on the glycoconjugate of interest, but use caution, as it also reacts with solution\/media that contains glycoconjugate.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1575670404}
