Introduction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.A. Vector Features<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>T-Overhangs for Easy PCR Cloning<\/strong>: The pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Vectors are\u00a0linearized vectors with a single 3'-terminal thymidine at both ends. The T-overhangs at the insertion site greatly improve the efficiency of ligation of PCR products by preventing recircularization of the vector and providing a compatible overhang for PCR products generated by certain thermostable polymerases (1,2).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Blue\/White Selection of Recombinants<\/strong>: The pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vectors are high-copy-number vectors containing T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase promoters flanking a multiple cloning\u00a0region\u00a0within the \u03b1-peptide coding region of the enzyme \u03b2-galactosidase. Insertional inactivation of the \u03b1-peptide allows identification of recombinants by blue\/white screening on indicator plates.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Choice of Restriction Sites for Release of Insert<\/strong>: Both the pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vectors contain numerous restriction sites within the multiple cloning\u00a0region. The pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector multiple cloning\u00a0region\u00a0is flanked by recognition sites for the restriction enzymes EcoRI, BstZI\u00a0and\u00a0NotI, providing three single-enzyme digestions for\u00a0release\u00a0of the insert. The pGEM\u00ae-T Vector cloning region is flanked by recognition sites for the enzyme BstZI. Alternatively, a double-digestion may be used to release the insert from either vector.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rapid Ligation<\/strong>: The pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector Systems are supplied with 2X Rapid Ligation Buffer. Ligation reactions using this buffer may be incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The incubation period may be extended to increase the number of colonies after transformation. Generally, an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C produces the maximum number of transformants.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.B. Important Considerations for Successful T-Vector Cloning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoid introduction of nucleases<\/strong>, which may degrade the T-overhangs on the vector. Use only the T4 DNA Ligase provided with the system, as this has been tested for minimal exonuclease activity. Use sterile, nuclease-free water in your ligation reactions.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use high-efficiency competent cells<\/strong> (\u22651 x 10<sup>8<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA) for transformations. The ligation of fragments with a single-base overhang can be inefficient, so it is essential to use cells with a transformation efficiency of at least 1 x 10<sup>8<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA in order to obtain a reasonable number of colonies. However, use of super high-efficiency competent cells (e.g., XL10 Gold\u00ae Cells) may result in a higher background of blue colonies.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limit exposure of your PCR product to shortwave UV light<\/strong> to avoid formation of pyrimidine dimers. Use a glass plate between the gel and UV source. If possible, only visualize the PCR product with a long-wave UV source.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.

However, ratios of 8:1 to 1:8 have been used successfully. If initial experiments with your PCR product are suboptimal, ratio optimization may be necessary. Ratios from 3:1 to 1:3 provide good initial parameters. The concentration of PCR product should be estimated by comparison to DNA mass standards on a gel or by using a fluorescent assay (3). The pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vectors are approximately 3kb and are supplied at 50ng\/\u03bcl. To calculate the appropriate amount of PCR product (insert) to include in the ligation reaction, use the following equation.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qwwfw26.png\" width=\"403\" height=\"43\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qwwfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 2.54.05 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Example of insert: vector ratio calculation:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How much 0.5kb PCR product should be added to a ligation in which 50ng of 3.0kb vector will be used if a 3:1 insert:vector molar ratio is desired?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qwxfw26.png\" width=\"252\" height=\"39\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qwxfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 2.54.12 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Using the same parameters for a 1:1 insert:vector molar ratio, 8.3ng of a 0.5kb insert would be required.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Tip: The Biomath calculator (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.promega.com\/biomath\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.promega.com\/biomath\/<\/a>) can be used to determine the amount of insert DNA needed.

We recommend using JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells (Cat.# L2001); these cells are provided with the pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM.-T Easy Vector Systems II. Other host strains may be used, but they should be compatible with blue\/white color screening and standard ampicillin selection.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: Use of super high-efficiency competent cells (e.g., XL10 Gold\u00ae Ultracompetent Cells) may result in a higher background of blue colonies.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you are using competent cells other than JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells purchased from Promega, it is important that the appropriate transformation protocol be followed.

Screening Transformants for Inserts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Successful cloning of an insert into the pGEM\u00ae-T or pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector interrupts the coding sequence of \u03b2-galactosidase; recombinant clones can be identified by color screening on indicator plates. However, the characteristics of the PCR products cloned into the vectors can significantly affect the ratio of blue:white colonies obtained.\u00a0Usually clones containing PCR products produce white colonies, but blue colonies can result from PCR fragments that are cloned in-frame with the lacZ gene. Such fragments are usually a multiple of 3 base pairs long (including the 3'L-A overhangs) and do not contain in-frame stop codons. There have been reports of DNA fragments up to 2kb that have been cloned in-frame and have produced blue colonies. Even if your PCR product is not a multiple of 3 bases long, the amplification process can introduce mutations (deletions or point mutations) that may result in blue colonies.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Control Insert DNA supplied with the pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Systems is a 542bp fragment from pGEM\u00ae-luc Vector DNA (Cat.# E1541). This sequence has been mutated to contain multiple stop codons in all six reading frames, which ensures a low background of blue colonies for the control reaction. Results obtained with the Control Insert DNA may not be representative of those achieved with your PCR product.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector Sequences, Multi-Cloning Sites and Circle Maps<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.A.

General Considerations for PCR Cloning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>6.A. PCR Product Purity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An aliquot of the PCR reaction should be analyzed on an agarose gel before use in the ligation reaction. The PCR product can be gel-purified or purified directly from the PCR amplification using the Wizard\u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Cat.# A9281). Exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light should be minimized to avoid the formation of pyrimidine dimers. Even if distinct bands of the expected size are observed, primer-dimers should be removed by gel purification or by using the Wizard\u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System. Use of crude PCR product may produce successful ligation in some cases; however, the number of white colonies containing the relevant insert may be reduced due to preferential incorporation of primer-dimers or other extraneous reaction products. Therefore, it may be necessary to screen numerous colonies in order to identify clones that contain the PCR product of interest.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>6.B.

Cloning Blunt-Ended PCR Products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thermostable DNA polymerases with proofreading activity, such as <em>Pfu<\/em> DNA Polymerase (Cat.# M7741), <em>Pwo<\/em> DNA polymerase and Tli DNA Polymerase, generate blunt-ended fragments. Nevertheless, PCR products generated using these polymerases can be modified using the A-tailing procedure outlined in Figure 3 and ligated into the pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vectors (5). Using this method, only one insert will be ligated into the vector (as opposed to multiple insertions that can occur with blunt-ended cloning). In addition, with T-vector cloning there is no need to dephosphorylate the vector, and there is a low background of religated vector.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Using this procedure with optimized insert:vector ratios, 55\u201395% recombinants were obtained when\u00a0<em>Pfu<\/em> and <em>Tli<\/em>\u00a0DNA Polymerases were used to generate the insert DNA (Table 2). It is critical that the PCR fragments are purified using the Wizard\u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Cat.# A9281) or by direct isolation from a gel by other means. In the absence of purification, the proofreading activity of the\u00a0<em>Pfu<\/em>,\u00a0<em>Pwo<\/em> and\u00a0<em>Tli\u00a0\u00a0<\/em>DNA Polymerases will degrade the PCR fragments, or remove the 3'-terminal deoxyadenosine added during tailing or the 3'-terminal deoxythymidine from the vector during the A-tailing reaction or ligation.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To optimize cloning efficiency, the amount of DNA in the A-tailing reaction and the ligation volumes must be adjusted depending on the molar yield of the purified PCR product. When molar concentrations are high due to small fragment size and\/or good amplification, small volumes of the PCR fragment are needed for the A-tailing and ligation reactions. However, when molar concentration is low due to large fragment size and\/or poor amplification, large volumes of the PCR fragment are needed for the A-tailing and ligation reactions. We have successfully used 1 7\u03bcl of purified PCR fragment in A-tailing reactions to optimize the insert:vector ratio. (See Section 3.B for further discussion of optimizing the insert:vector ratio.) Recombinants were identified by blue\/white screening, and 70\u2013100% were shown to have the correct size insert by PCR. Few recombinants were observed in control reactions in which the PCR fragment was not tailed. These control results confirm that the majority of the pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector used contained 3'-terminal deoxythymidine and that, during the A-tailing, <em>Taq<\/em> DNA Polymerase added a 3'-terminal deoxyadenosine to a significant proportion of the PCR fragments.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qxnfw26.png\" width=\"626\" height=\"360\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qxmfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 3.32.33 PM.png\" \/><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qxrfw26.png\" width=\"691\" height=\"373\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qxqfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 3.33.05 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Experimental Controls<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Positive Control<\/strong>: Set up a ligation reaction with the Control Insert DNA as described in Section 3 and use it for transformations. This control will allow you to determine whether the ligation is proceeding efficiently. Typically, approximately 100 colonies should be observed, 10\u201340% of which are blue, when competent cells that have a transformation efficiency of 1 x 10<sup>8<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA are transformed. Greater than 60% of the colonies should be white. The Control Insert DNA is designed to produce white colonies; however, other insert DNA may not yield white colonies (see Section 4.C). Background blue colonies from the positive control ligation reaction arise from non-T tailed or undigested pGEM\u00ae-T or pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector. These blue colonies are a useful internal transformation control; if no colonies are obtained, the transformation has failed. If small numbers of blue colonies are obtained, but no whites, the ligation reaction may have failed. If &lt;50% white colonies are seen in the positive control reaction, then the ligation conditions were probably suboptimal or nuclease contamination of the ligation reaction may have occurred.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The concentration of the Control Insert DNA is such that 2\u03bcl (4ng\/\u03bcl) can be used in a 10\u03bcl ligation reaction to achieve a 1:1 molar ratio with 50ng of the pGEM\u00ae-T or pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vectors.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Background Control<\/strong>: Set up a ligation reaction with 50ng of pGEM\u00ae-T or pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector and no insert as described in Section 3, and use it for transformations. This control allows determination of the number of background blue colonies resulting from non-T-tailed or undigested pGEM\u00ae-T or pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector alone. If the recommendations in Section 4 are followed, 10\u201330 blue colonies will typically be observed if the transformation efficiency of the competent cells is 1 x 10<sup>8<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA. (Under these conditions, cells that have an efficiency of 1 x 10<sup><span style=\"font-size: 10.8333px;\">7<\/span><\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA would yield 1\u20133 blue colonies, and cells with a transformation efficiency of 1\u00a0x 10<sup>9<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA would yield 100\u2013300 blue colonies). Compare the number of blue colonies obtained with this background control to the number of blue colonies obtained in the standard reaction using the PCR product. If ligation of the PCR product yields dramatically more blue colonies than the background control reaction, then recombinants are probably among these blue colonies (see Section 4.C).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformation Control<\/strong>: Check the transformation efficiency of the competent cells by transforming them with an uncut plasmid (not pGEM\u00ae-T or pGEM\u00ae-T Easy, since these vectors are linearized) and calculating cfu\/\u03bcg DNA. If the transformation efficiency is lower than1\u00a0x 10<sup>8<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA, prepare fresh cells. If you are not using JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells (provided with\u00a0 pGEM\u00ae-T and pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector Systems II; Cat.# A3610 and A1380, respectively), be sure the cells are compatible with blue\/white screening and standard ampicillin selection and have a transformation efficiency of at least 1\u00a0x 10<sup>8<\/sup>cfu\/\u03bcg DNA.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>8.
