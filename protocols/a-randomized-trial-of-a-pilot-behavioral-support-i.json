We evaluated the feasibility of a<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">postoperative support program targeting quality of life, psychosocial functioning and adherence to behavior change in bariatric surgery patients. This prospective, randomized pilot trial evaluated a comprehensive postoperative behavioral support intervention using a 4-month bi-weekly program in 24 bariatric surgery patients compared to 26 usual care patients that completed bariatric surgery within one year. Outcomes included feasibiilty and the difference in quality of life (as measured by the Short Form-36) between groups, as well as differences in psychosocial functioning (mood, eating behaviors) and adherence (diet, physical activity, appointments). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and treatment completion (4 months). The intervention focused on addressing psychosocial changes after surgery, strategies for postoperative diet and adherence, and preventing weight regain. Patients collaboratively set goals for diet, physical activity, adherence and other behavioral changes tailored to the needs of each participant. Intervention patients were asked to attend 8, one-hour bi-weekly treatment sessions in a 4-month time period.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1571760364}
