You can see on the scale that number 6 is an intensity that means no exertion at all, whilst number 20 means maximal exertion. The numbers in between these extremes represent different levels of effort. For example a rating of 9 means a very light effort, which for a normal healthy person, is like walking slowly for a few minutes. A rating of 13 means the exercise is getting somewhat hard, but it still feels OK to continue at this level of exertion. Number 17 means exercise that is very strenuous. At this level, you can still go on, but you really have to push yourself as it feels very heavy and you are very tired. Number 20 is an extremely strenuous exercise level, which for many people is the most strenuous exercise they have ever experienced or could imagine experiencing. Please look at the scale and familiarise yourself with the numbers and words. When we begin, I will ask you to work at an RPE of 11. You will be asked to adjust the intensity to match a rating of 11 for 2 minutes. This will be followed by further bouts of 2 minutes at 13, 15, 17 and 20 on the scale. You will be free to change the resistance as often as required in order to maintain the desired rating and in the final stage in order to achieve a maximal effort that ends in volitional exhaustion after 2 minutes. Every 30 seconds we will make you aware of how much time you have left in order to achieve this effort. Please focus on your overall feelings, not just your arms or breathing.
