It tests the peripheral and central vestibular pathway and has been used to test brainstem functions and postural reflexes. VEMP tests the vestibulospinal and vestibulo-ocular reflexes involved in the control of the postural balance. Normal VEMP depends on the functional integrity of the saccular and utricular maculae, the inferior vestibular nerve, the superior vestibular nerve, the vestibular nuclei, the central vestibular pathways, and the neuromuscular plaques involved in these reflexes. This test presents characteristics favorable to its use in clinical practice: objectivity, non-invasiveness, easy execution, low cost, rapidity, and minimal discomfort for the patient.This protocol aims at showing how to perform Simultaneous ocular and cervical VEMP.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1565025162}
