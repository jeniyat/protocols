To test media\u00a0consistency when we receive a new batch of media, we perform control experiments\u00a0on cells grown with both the old and\u00a0new media lots. To maintain consistency across shaker platforms, we use a digital tachometer to ensure identical shaking speed, and we measure the temperature of a control flask of water every morning.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Timing is also a very important consideration. We use multi-channel pipettors or pinners and work quickly, especially when transferring cells from the secondary stress to fresh media. We process a maximum of two\u00a096-well plates at a time to ensure that viability differences across strains are not due to differences in exposure time to the secondary stress. This was determined in our lab empirically for our yeast strains using technical replicates across multiple plates, and we would recommend this procedure when adopting this protocol for new organisms or stress exposure times.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"330103","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"5F32AE651B8B4A1AB929D562C402391E","previous_guid":"C7960D64CC1C47C488FD86B7D5544918","previous_id":"574691","last_modified":"1497634677","components":[{"component_id":"494656","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"6410F4D849DE4AE3BF84D33B87E69098","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"<ul>\n<li>Starting with a saturated culture, sub-culture and grow cells at 30\u00b0C with 270 rpm orbital shaking at least 8 generations\u00a0to early-to-mid exponential phase (OD<sub>600<\/sub>\u00a0~0.3 - 0.6 on a Unico\u00a01100RS Spectrophotometer).
