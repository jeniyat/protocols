In the presence of a specific restriction enzyme, the random lifation will ligate the oligoncleotides which had been synthesized. At the same time, the repeat oligonucleotides which is produced in the head-to-tail direction will be chosen. After that, the study performed that the selected repeat oligonucleotides will be cloned into a modified expression vector and expressed as a fusion protein in a bacterial system. The purified repeat peptides are used as immunogens to generate pAbs and mAbs. Finally, the resulting Abs will be evaluated to ensure their specificity for human brain proteins compared to brain protein from other mammals.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">What should be needed for this method?<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Oligonucleotides were incorporated at the Exploration Office in Seoul National College.
