It is based on the direct sandwich technique in which two monoclonal antibodies are directed against separate antigenic determinants on the insulin molecule. During incubation insulin in the sample reacts with peroxidase-conjugated anti-insulin antibodies and anti-insulin antibodies bound to microplate wells. A simple washing step removes unbound enzyme labeledantibody. The bound conjugate is detected by reaction with 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction is stopped by adding acid to give a colorimetric endpoint that is read spectrophotometrically. This assay is a Sandwich ELISA based, sequentially, on:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1) capture of insulin molecules from samples to the wells of a microtiter plate coated by pre-titered amount of a monoclonal mouse anti-rat insulin antibodies and the binding of biotinylated polyclonal antibodies to the captured insulin, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2) wash away of unbound materials from samples, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3) binding of horseradish peroxidase to the immobilized biotinylated antibodies, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4) wash away of free enzyme conjugates, and <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5) quantification of immobilized antibody- enzyme conjugates by monitoring horseradish peroxidase activities in the presence of the substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The enzyme activity is measured spectrophotometrically by the increased absorbency at 450 nm, corrected from the absorbency at 590nm, after acidification of formed products. Since the increase in absorbency is directly proportional to the amount of captured insulin in the unknown sample, the latter can be derived by interpolation from a reference curve generated in the same assay with reference standards of known concentrations of rat insulin.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0}],"materials":[{"id":181003,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Mouse Sensitive Insulin ELISA","linfor":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.mercodia.se\/mercodia-mouse-insulin-elisa","sku":"10-1247-01","cas_number":"","rrid":"AB_2783837","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Mercodia","affiliation":null,"username":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.mercodia.com","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"id":571},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}},{"id":181004,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA","linfor":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.mercodia.se\/mercodia-ultrasensitive-mouse-insulin-elisa","sku":"10-1249-01","cas_number":"","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Mercodia","affiliation":null,"username":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.mercodia.com","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"id":571},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}}],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Summary: <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Mouse Insulin ELISA kit is used for the non radioactive quantification of insulin in mouse plasma.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557337040}
