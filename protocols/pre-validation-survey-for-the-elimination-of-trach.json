Ghana achieved the thresholds in 2008, and since 2011 have been implementing their trachoma surveillance strategy, which includes community and school screening for signs of follicular trachoma and trichiasis, in each trachoma-endemic district. In 2015, the country plans to conduct a number of district level population based survey to verify elimination of blinding trachoma. This decision is currently made based on prevalence of clinical evaluation of \u201ctrachomatous trichiasis\u201d and \u201ctrachomatous inflammation \u2013 follicular\u201d (TF), the second of which has been shown to be a problematic indicator in low prevalence settings. Further evidence is required to determine the optimal surveillance strategy and indicators for trachoma.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Objectives<\/strong>: This study will determine if Ghana has sustained the elimination prevalence thresholds. Additionally, the study will review the trachoma surveillance strategy employed in Ghana and if it was able to identify any potential resurgence of infection. It will also assess the relationships between the prevalence of the clinical sign TF, compared to prevalence of infection and antibody levels, after completion of what most observers believe to have been a successful programme. This will help to determine whether it may be appropriate to consider one or more alternative indicators for validating elimination of blinding trachoma. Surveillance for other infections (including yaws and other NTDs) will also be integrated into the pre-validation trachoma survey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods<\/strong>: The standard World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended population-based prevalence survey will be conducted in areas already scheduled to conduct validation surveys in 2015, but with the addition of eye swabbing to test for infection and finger pricking to collect bloodspots for antibody testing. Villages identified with a TF prevalence \u22655%, either retrospectively, during the on-going surveillance or during the district level survey (index village), will result in focal screening of children in neighbouring villages (and the \u2018index\u2019 village), including a clinical assessment and tests for trachoma infection and antibody levels. Surveillance for additional infections will also be included through antibody testing using the same sera collected for trachoma. Finally, document analysis and qualitative methodologies will be employed to review the operationalization of the trachoma surveillance system in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact:<\/strong> Results from this study will provide the Ghana Health Service with evidence, as to whether the country has sustained their elimination targets for trachoma. It will also inform the WHO-led Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020) on the appropriateness of alternative indicators and surveillance methodologies for verification of blinding trachoma.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"6149","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1496318243","protocol_affiliation":"1.

Based on the implementation and scale up of this strategy, the World Health Assembly set the global goal to eliminate blinding trachoma by 2020 [WHA, 1998].<\/p>\n<p>Countries or districts are eligible for acknowledgement of elimination of blinding trachoma when they provide evidence that they have reached the elimination prevalence thresholds<a href=\"#_ftn1\" target=\"_blank\">[1]<\/a>\u00a0 and sustained those achievements for at least three years [WHO, 2010]. A suitable surveillance strategy is therefore required to provide evidence that elimination prevalence targets have been sustained and to identify any potential resurgence of disease.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After initial baseline prevalence surveys in 2000, Ghana initiated a programme to eliminate blinding trachoma in the Northern and Upper West Regions. Full SAFE interventions started in 5 districts where trachoma was found to be a public health problem. An evaluation survey conducted in the first five districts after two years of implementing control activities showed between 41-79% reduction in the prevalence of active trachoma [Ghana Health Service Trachoma Control Programme 2003]. The SAFE strategy was extended to a sixth district in 2002 and after completing baseline surveys in all areas, by 2004 endemic communities in all districts in the two regions received full SAFE. With a full knowledge of trachoma endemic areas, the National Trachoma Control Program developed a five year strategic plan (2005-2009) to guide trachoma control activities [Ghana Health Service 2005]. The plan set various targets with the ultimate goal to eliminate blinding trachoma from Ghana by 2010. The plan also provided benchmarks to assess programme performance, such as evaluating the impact of at least three years of SAFE strategy on the prevalence of disease.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Ghana is one of the countries in the post-endemic surveillance stage [WHO 2012]. Following a post-intervention impact assessment in 2008 after all endemic communities had received at least three years of SAFE interventions, the prevalence of TF fell to 0.14-2.87% from a baseline of 2.8-16.1% in 2003 [Yayemain et al. 2009]. These results revealed that Ghana has reached the ultimate intervention goal of reducing TF in children aged 1-9 years to &lt;5.0% in all endemic districts. However, in order to achieve elimination of blinding trachoma, it is required that TF in children aged 1-9 years remains at &lt;5% after interventions to control trachoma have ceased [Resnikoff et al. 2007, WHO 2013]. Further, the target threshold for elimination of trichiasis is a prevalence of TT &lt;0.1% in 15 years and older. TT prevalence fell from 0.4-8.4% in 2003 to 0.05-1.07% in 2008 [Yayemain et al. 2009], but is still above the recommended threshold for validation of elimination in some districts (Table 1).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Following the post-intervention impact assessment, a post MDA surveillance strategy was put in place between 2011 and 2014, conducting both active and passive surveillance for Trachomatous Inflammation- Follicular (TF) and Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) cases [GHS, 2010]. The surveillance strategy included the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passive surveillance for TT cases in all health facilities, integrated into the Integrated Disease Surveillance Report (IDSR) reporting<\/li>\n<li>A convenience sample of children (aged 1-9 years) in two communities per year assessed for signs of TF. If the TF prevalence was \u22655%, then second line or neighbouring communities were also assessed for signs of clinical trachoma [WHO, 2008]<\/li>\n<li>School screening was conducted at the beginning of the school year in pre-school children, up to class three<\/li>\n<li>Sentinel sites selected for assessment of trichiasis cases in the community<\/li>\n<li>Prevalence based survey to validate if elimination targets have been sustained, at least three years after stopping MDA<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<p>There is therefore the need to evaluate the current prevalence of active trachoma as a first step towards the validation of Ghana as a trachoma free country. Further re-emergence of infection after MDA is a possibility (West et al. 2011), and as such the prevalence of disease must be regularly monitored to ensure that the gains made during 10 years of control activities are maintained. This protocol seeks to guide the surveillance assessment after 2014.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the latest guidance from WHO (which still needs to be ratified by WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group (STAG) on NTDs) recommends that sentinel site data are no longer recommended but the verification is to be primarily based upon a single cross-sectional epidemiologically rigorous prevalence survey, to be conducted at the district level, at least 2.5 years after the last round of antibiotic distribution. A review of the Ghana surveillance system provides a potential opportunity to provide evidence as to the relative effectiveness of these different approaches, the on-going surveillance strategy and the one-off cross-sectional population based survey.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the recommendations are based on the diagnosis of trachoma using clinical signs, as outlined in the WHO simplified grading system [Thylefors, 1987]. However, the use of TF as an indicator for trachoma in low prevalence settings can be suboptimal:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The correlation between follicular trachoma and C. trachomatis infection is poor in low prevalence settings, often with much higher levels of TF compared to infection [Burr et al, 2013; Burton et al, 2011; Munoz et al, 2011].<\/li>\n<li>Post infection, it is uncertain how long TF lasts in an individual<\/li>\n<li>Follicles can be caused by infection with pathogens other than C. trachomatis<\/li>\n<li>Concerns over the low inter-grader reliability and precision of grading TF [Miller et al, 2004]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<p>Therefore, diagnosis of TF as an indication of programme success can have low specificity in areas of low infection prevalence. Relying on an indicator that has low specificity and may over-estimate the prevalence of infection in the community can result in a waste of valuable resources, especially if potential \u2018hotspots\u2019 of infection are wrongfully identified and antibiotics are unnecessarily distributed. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Alternative indicators to provide evidence for elimination have been suggested and tested in a number of settings. Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT), including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific tests [Keenan et al, 2012; Mabey and Solomon, 2003] however it is not yet clear how to use the results in program decision making. In addition, the NAAT tests for C. trachomatis infection are still quite expensive and must be conducted by specialised technicians in a laboratory where a NAAT platform is available, which may or may not be readily available in-country.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The use of serological tests (detecting antibody responses to chlamydial antigens e.g pgp3 and CT694) [Goodhew et al, 2012; Goodhew et al, 2014] provides an opportunity to determine prevalence of exposure to infection and if combined with age can potentially give a useful indicator of transmission intensity over time (especially after antibiotic distribution was stopped). The use of multiplex assays also provides the opportunity to integrate tests for a number of other pathogens using the same sera, saving costs across public health programmes. Further research is required in order to determine the interpretation and potential utility of using the prevalence of antibodies to C. trachomatis in decision-making around the elimination of blinding trachoma.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Further evidence is also required in order to better understand the thresholds for potential resurgence of infection and the implications. It is believed that repeated exposure to C. trachomatis bacteria is necessary for an immunopathologic response in an individual. If infection levels remain low this progression in sequelae and potential blindness, may not be a concern [Grayston et al, 1991; Bobo et al, 1985; Detels et al, 1966].

If infection levels remain low this progression in sequelae and potential blindness, may not be a concern [Grayston et al, 1991; Bobo et al, 1985; Detels et al, 1966].

There is a single rainy season, from May to October, when humidity generally reaches 70-90%. During the long dry season (November to April), the humidity drops significantly and the colder, dusty and dry harmattan winds blow northeast. Many farmers migrate south during this period. A number of rivers run through the regions, including the tributaries of the Volta (Black Volta, White Volta), Kulpawn and Sissili. However, many communities in these regions rely on underground water, especially during the dry season.<\/p>\n<p>The ethnic groups of the regions are diverse and distinct, each having their own beliefs and traditional practices. However the predominant ethnic groups in the study areas are Sissala and Dagaaba in the Upper West and Dagomba, Konkomba and Gonja in the Northern region.\u00a0 The literacy rate among adults in this part of the country is among the lowest in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>These two regions were identified as trachoma endemic regions between 2001-2004, see table 1 below. In 2008, all 37 districts (split from 18 parent districts) were declared to have achieved the elimination prevalence thresholds and mass distribution of antibiotics was stopped. Surveillance activities began in 2011 and a validation survey is to be conducted in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of this study, districts will be combined back to their original parent districts

the two trachoma endemic regions of Northern and Upper West regions of Ghana. There is a single rainy season, from May to October, when humidity generally reaches 70-90%. During the long dry season (November to April), the humidity drops significantly and the colder, dusty and dry harmattan winds blow northeast. Many farmers migrate south during this period. A number of rivers run through the regions, including the tributaries of the Volta (Black Volta, White Volta), Kulpawn and Sissili. However, many communities in these regions rely on underground water, especially during the dry season.<\/p>\n<p>The ethnic groups of the regions are diverse and distinct, each having their own beliefs and traditional practices. However the predominant ethnic groups in the study areas are Sissala and Dagaaba in the Upper West and Dagomba, Konkomba and Gonja in the Northern region.\u00a0 The literacy rate among adults in this part of the country is among the lowest in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>These two regions were identified as trachoma endemic regions between 2001-2004, see table 1 below. In 2008, all 37 districts (split from 18 parent districts) were declared to have achieved the elimination prevalence thresholds and mass distribution of antibiotics was stopped. Surveillance activities began in 2011 and a validation survey is to be conducted in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of this study, districts will be combined back to their original parent districts (same as those used for the baseline study) to create 18 evaluation units with a population of between 100,000 to 250,000 population, see Annex A.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Table 1: Trachoma prevalence
