More than 100,000 people die each year in the United States as a result of PE. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Numerous studies have shown that VTE prophylaxis is vastly underutilized in hospitals and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has listed strategies to improve VTE prevention on its top ten list for patient safety practices. Consequently, numerous interventions have been implemented to improve prescription of VTE prophylaxis with the implicit assumption that medications prescribed for hospitalized patients will always be administered. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">There are deficits in the administration of Prescribed Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis. Although the benefit of VTE prophylaxis is well established, many hospitalized patients do not receive adequate VTE prophylaxis. The rationale for the Patient-centered Education Bundle is driven by the high frequency of patient refusal of VTE prophylaxis and significant knowledge gaps regarding VTE, there is an urgent need to educate patients and families on the importance and benefits of compliance with VTE prophylaxis. As part of a study funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), we first educated nurses on the harms of VTE and the benefits of prophylaxis, showing that this first step intervention improved VTE prophylaxis administration by approximately 10%. The patient-centered education bundle will be delivered as an in-person, 1-on-1 discussion session with a nurse educator. Supporting education materials include a 2-page education sheet and an educational video. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1579277167}
