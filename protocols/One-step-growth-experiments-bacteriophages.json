Latent period and burst size are essential parameters in a description of phage properties and varies between phages and hosts and also with host growth conditions. The latent period is the minimum length of time it takes from adsorption of the phages to a host cell to lysis of the host with release of progeny viruses (Fig. 1). The burst size is the average number of phages released per infected host cell. The one-step experiment can be adapted to test the effects of different environmental factors on the infection process. For example, the burst size can be affected by the growth rate of the host (e.g., Middelboe 2000); they are expected to be higher when the host cell is nutrient replete and growing exponentially while one might expect a decrease in burst size if the host cells are under nutrient limitation.\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0<br \/><br \/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img id=\"s-mce-img\"
