The parameters calculated from repeated measurements can be used for separate analyses: analysis of center of pressure displacement, represented by total travelled way parameter; analysis of body weight distribution and loading of the lower limbs; and foot typology. The guidelines are mostly based on recommendations of the literature, partly on our own research experiences. It is important to remain consistent during all of the measurements and follow the guidelines as they control important aspects of the measurements. Any changes of any aspects can signifficantly alter the final results.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>Set the pleasent temperature in the lab and avoid any noise occurence during the testing.<\/p>\n<p>Register related health problems history (injury, visual, muskuloskeletal, neurologic, psychologic problems and diseases).<\/p>\n<p>Take basic anthropometric data of the participants - body weight, body height, and foot size and length.<\/p>\n<p>Ensure the participant is helathy, in a good physical and psychological state, and able to stand on one leg without problem.<\/p>\n<p>Inform the participant about the whole measurement process and main goal: to be as motionless as possible during the testing.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126237","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"RS Footscan Balance tensometric plate ","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126238","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"2D motion analysis software","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126239","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Electronic spreadsheet software for storing, organizing and calculating data","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"materials_text":null,"warning":"<p>It is not intended for people sufferred any acute or chronic pain of muskuloskeletal system, and with any neurologic and psychologic health problems in the time of the measurements.<\/p>\n<p>It is strictly prohibited to underwent the measuremets under a drug or other substance affecting perception, concentration, mood, or behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Researcher should avoid any unsafe objects from at least 3 m arround the tensometric platform and carefully inform the participants prefere their safety and avoid the injury.<\/p>","version_class":"12768","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1528131007","protocol_affiliation":"Research Sport Centre, Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.qp8dvrw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"431384x2q2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/2gk2byn.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/006.png","full_name":"Jitka Marencakova","created_by":"Jitka Marencakova","private_link":"89E8C805BA73C3082C42DB0D98810929","original_img":"1","username":"jitka-marencakova","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0204578","manuscript_citation":"Marencakova J,  Maly T,  Sugimoto D,  Gryc T,  Zahalka F (2018) Foot typology, body weight distribution, and postural stability of adolescent elite soccer players: A 3-year longitudinal study.
