Immunotherapy works by activating the patient's own immune system to target cancer cells. CAR-T cell therapy has shown significant activity in certain cancers, and two CAR-T therapies, Kymriah and Yescarta, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B-cell lymphoma.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>However, despite advances in CAR-T cell therapy, scientists have not yet fully determined how CAR-T cells function in structure. Recently, researchers from the Moffitt Cancer Center in the United States have solved this problem and described the mechanism of action of these new drugs.
