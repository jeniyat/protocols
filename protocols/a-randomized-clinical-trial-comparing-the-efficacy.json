Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group one received metronidazole 500mg, bismuth subcitrate 240mg and amoxicillin 1000mg, all three times a day and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day (amoxicillin group)for14 days. The second group received metronidazole 500mg three times a day and bismuth subcitrate240mg and tetracycline HCL 500mg both four times a day and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day (tetracycline group), for 14 days. Evaluation for compliance and drugs side effects were done after two weeks. Eight weeks after treatment, H.pylori eradication rate was assessed by c13-urease breath test.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Results: Two hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. There was no statistically significant demographic difference between two groups. Amoxicillin containing regimen achieved higher Eradication rate: 105 of 110 ,95.51% (95%CI 91.5% to 99.3%) and 88 of 105, 83.8% (95% CI 76.7% to 90.8%) by per-protocol analysis (p-value=0.005) and 92.9%(95%CI 88.1% to 97.6%) and 76.5% (95% CI 68.7% to 84.2%) by intention-to-treat (p-value=0.001) for amoxicillin and tetracycline groups, respectively.

H. pylori causes peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (2). Although the bacterium is susceptible to most antimicrobial agents invitro, successful treatment of H.pylori remains a challenge (3). Factors contributing to success in H. pylori treatment are drug efficacy, host compliance, and bacterial resistance (1, 2). Resistance to commonly used drugs such as metronidazole and clarithromycin, is the most important reason for treatment failure of current regimens (1). Emerging evidence shows high resistance to clarithromycin in countries with high consumption of macrolide derivatives (4), whereas regimen containing clarithromycin was reported to achieve 80% eradication rate (5). Previous studies from our region (Iran) revealed that more than 20% of H. pylori isolates were resistant to clarithromycin and that over 50% of the H. pylori isolates were resistant to metronidazole (6-8).<br \/>Due to high resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin, regimens containing these antibiotics are not efficient (9). In some studies on patients with metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, bismuth-based quadruple therapy was reported as a preferable regimen for eradication of H. pylori (10, 11). This bismuth-based quadruple therapy includes bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and tetracycline together with metronidazole or tinidazole, with proper doses and duration. Quadruple regimen with suboptimal metronidazole doses (&lt;1500 mg\/day) was reported to achieve an overall eradication rate of 70% (3,4). Increasing the dose of metronidazole in bismuth-based quadruple therapy was the first step in increasing eradication rates to acceptable levels, and bismuth compound was reported to be necessary for such response (12, 13). However, low compliance, as well as increased side effects, are major issues that arise if full-dose metronidazole and tetracycline are used. There is also some evidence suggesting an increase in H.pylori resistance to tetracycline (14-16).<br \/>Outcomes with substitution of tetracycline with amoxicillin in bismuth-based quadruple therapy have not been widely studied, especially in countries with high H.pylori resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin such as Iran. Our pilot study revealed that a very good H.pylori eradication rate could be achieved with a modified bismuth-based quadruple therapy containing high-dose amoxicillin (3 g\/day), adequate-dose metronidazole (1.5 g\/day), and a PPI. Therefore, this open-label, randomized clinical trial was designed to compare the classic bismuth-based quadruple regimen containing metronidazole (1500mg\/day) with a modified bismuth-based quadruple therapy containing high-dose amoxicillin (3 g\/day), metronidazole (1.5 g\/day), and a PPI, with the aim to compare eradication rates, adverse effects, and patient compliance<\/p>","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium that infects approximately 50% of people in industrialized nations and up to 80% in less-developed countries (1). H. pylori causes peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (2). Although the bacterium is susceptible to most antimicrobial agents invitro, successful treatment of H.pylori remains a challenge (3). Factors contributing to success in H. pylori treatment are drug efficacy, host compliance, and bacterial resistance (1, 2). Resistance to commonly used drugs such as metronidazole and clarithromycin, is the most important reason for treatment failure of current regimens (1). Emerging evidence shows high resistance to clarithromycin in countries with high consumption of macrolide derivatives (4), whereas regimen containing clarithromycin was reported to achieve 80% eradication rate (5). Previous studies from our region (Iran) revealed that more than 20% of H. pylori isolates were resistant to clarithromycin and that over 50% of the H. pylori isolates were resistant to metronidazole (6-8).<br \/>Due to high resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin, regimens containing these antibiotics are not efficient (9).
