For the present study were consider number of residents (IBGE, 2011), parameters regarding road connectivity and land use and vegetation cover (SIEG, 2018), and the urban area slope parameter generated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (MDE \u2013 SRTM), with a spatial resolution of 30 m (EMBRAPA, 1979).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Use GIS.
