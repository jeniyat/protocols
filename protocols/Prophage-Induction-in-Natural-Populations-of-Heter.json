This can be accomplished by several methods (see Weinbauer et al., this volume). Prokaryotic cells with reduced viral abundance (25\u201350 mL) are incubated at in situ temperature in triplicates with or without inducing agent C (see also above). Samples for enumeration of prokaryotes and viruses are taken periodically and fixed as described above. Calculation of induced viral production and the percentage of cells containing a prophage (% lysogens) is calculated as described above.<br \/><br \/><strong>References<br \/><br \/><\/strong>Chen, F., J.
