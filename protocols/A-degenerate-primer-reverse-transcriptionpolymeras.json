It is based on a strategy first reported by Culley et al. (2003) and refined by Culley and Steward (2007). All picorna-like viruses have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes and are classified in the order Picornavirales (Le Gall et al. 2008). Picorna-like viruses are responsible for several significant human and animal diseases and infect a diversity of marine protists including a diatom (Nagasaki 2008; Lang et al. 2009). The procedure outlined below uses direct filtration of relatively small volumes of water and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene fragment using degenerate primer sets. <br \/><br \/>With this method, viral polymerase sequences were amplified in several distinct aquatic environments, including an estuarine urban canal (Ala Wai canal, Waikiki, HI, USA), a tropical bay (Kaneohe Bay, HI, USA), and a temperate bay (Monterey Bay, CA, USA). Amplification occurred in samples from the same site in different seasons and at different depths showing that RNA viruses are widespread and consistently present. Sequencing of the amplified gene fragments revealed novel sequences that are highly divergent from any known isolates.<strong><br \/><br \/>Equipment<\/strong>\u2014Peristaltic pump and pump heads,
