All sections (3 micrometers in thickness) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS, Thermo Scientific) or Masson\u2019s trichrome staining (MTS, Sigma) according to the standard procedures or manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For transmission electro micrographs (EM), kidneys were fixed in Karnovsky\u2019s fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1% cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 for 2 hrs at room temperature, followed by postfixation with 1% osmunim tetraoxide in cacodylate buffer for 90 min at 4\u02daC and mordanting with 1% tannic acid in cacodylate buffer.. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Hitachi H-7600 transmission electron microscope located in the Imaging Core Facility of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. We followed previously described histological scoring methods (33). <\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"6553","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1503693356","protocol_affiliation":"Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation; Boston Children's Hospital, United States.,Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, United States.,Boston Children's Hospital, United States.","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.imzcc76","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x20374w2t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/013.png","full_name":"Kai Song","created_by":"Kai Song","private_link":"D6DB550C7897F631A91A5713B13E52B4","original_img":"1","username":"kai-song","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28842487#\" target=\"_blank\">J Biol Chem.<\/a>\u00a02017 Aug 25. pii: jbc.M117.798512. doi: 10.1074\/jbc.M117.798512.
