Briefly, 80 \u03bcl platelet poor plasma (PPP) was mixed with 20 \u03bcl of a mixture containing tissue factor (Dade-Behring) at a final concentration of 1 pM and phospholipid vesicles (f.c. 4 \u03bcM 20 mol% phosphatidylserine, 60 mol% phosphatidylcholine and 20 mol% phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, Avanti). To calibrator wells, 20 \u03bcl of calibrator (\u03b12macroglobulin- thrombin complex, [19]) was added instead of TF and PL. After 10 minutes of incubation at 37\u00b0C, thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of 20 \u03bcl of the thrombin specific substrate, Z- Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (f.c. 416 \u03bcM, Bachem) and CaCl2 (f.c. 16.7 mM). Fluorescence was measured with a Fluoroscan Ascent reader (Thermo Labsystems) and data were analyzed with dedicated software (Thrombinoscope, Stago) [20]. Thrombin generation was expressed based on endogenous thrombin potential (ETP); lagtime (LT); thrombin peak (TP), time-to-thrombin peak (TTP).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8511","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1509542087","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium.,Synapse Research Institute, Maastricht, The Netherlands.,Department of Surgery, ZOL, Genk, Belgium,Department of Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, China.,Central Diagnostic Laboratory,ZOL, Genk, Belgium,Department of Anesthesiology, ICU and Perioperative Medicine,HMC, Doha,Qatar","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ki7cuhn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Sven-y2v284w2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ps4h8ae.jpg","full_name":"Sven Van Poucke","created_by":"Sven Van Poucke","private_link":"ACAE79FE6C7B015BC2164E5FAB131315","original_img":"1","username":"sven-van-poucke","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":272970,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"524","group_uri":"hipacat","group_name":"HIPACAT","group_logo":"","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Thrombin","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"1","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Sven Van Poucke,Dana Huskens,Kurt Van der Speeten,Mark Roest,Bart Lauwereins,Ming-Hua Zheng,Seppe Dehaene,Joris Penders,Abraham Marcus,Marcus Lanc\u00e9","authors_list":[{"name":"Sven Van Poucke","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium.","username":"sven-van-poucke","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ps4h8ae.jpg"},{"name":"Dana Huskens","affiliation":"Synapse Research Institute, Maastricht, The Netherlands.","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Kurt Van der Speeten","affiliation":"Department of Surgery, ZOL, Genk, Belgium","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Mark Roest","affiliation":"Synapse Research Institute, Maastricht, The Netherlands.","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Bart Lauwereins","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium.","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","affiliation":"Department of Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, China.","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Seppe Dehaene","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium.","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Joris Penders","affiliation":"Central Diagnostic Laboratory,ZOL, Genk, Belgium","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Abraham Marcus","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, ICU and Perioperative Medicine,HMC, Doha,Qatar","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Marcus Lanc\u00e9","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, ICU and Perioperative Medicine,HMC, Doha,Qatar","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ps4h8ae.jpg","username":"sven-van-poucke","full_name":"Sven Van Poucke","created_by":"Sven Van Poucke"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[]}
