A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, and eligible studies were included.

The extent of heterogeneity across studies will be checked using the chi-squared test and I-squared test; p=0.10 and\/or I2&gt;50% indicating significant heterogeneity. For evaluating source of heterogeneity, sub-group analysis and meta-regression will be used.\u00a0 The potential for publication bias was assessed using funnel plot, the Begg rank correlation method, and the Egger weighted regression method.

Q-tests based on the \u03c7<sup>2<\/sup> statistic and I<sup>2<\/sup> statistic will be employed to investigate the heterogeneity among the studies (29-31). If substantial heterogeneity existed (<em>P<\/em>&lt;0.05 for the Q statistic or I<sup>2<\/sup>&gt;50%), a random effect model will be applied to pool the ORs; if not, a fixed effect model was applied (32, 33). In addition, a meta-regression analysis will be performed to discover the underlying reasons for statistical heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis will be carried out to measure the effects of single studies on the overall estimate by ignoring one study at a time. A funnel plot, the trim-and-fill method, Begg\u2019s test, and Egger\u2019s test will be applied to assess publication bias.
