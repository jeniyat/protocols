After video watching, subjects are warmed up for 5 min. with global movements. Initial feet positions are marked on the support base with adhesive tapes (5-cm width). Other adhesive tape marks are fixed 15 cm away from the outer border of the feet to either side, in parallel to the feet orientation. The initial participant\u2019s posture on the platform is keeping the Romberg\u2019s stance, with the feet oriented forward, touching each other, maintaining both arms relaxed hanging beside the trunk, and palms of the hands lightly touching the upper legs. Participants wear a safety harness supported by two ropes tied at the shoulders height with the other end attached overhead. The participant\u2019s aim across perturbations is to recover balance after support base displacements trying to maintain the initial body posture.
