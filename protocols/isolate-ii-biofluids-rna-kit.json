Total RNA can be purified from blood, plasma, serum and other types of biofluids such as saliva, urine, semen and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Viral RNA can be isolated from the same sample sources, as well as cultured cells and tissue. The kit isolates all sizes of RNA from large mRNA, viral RNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) down to small RNAs such as microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA (siRNA).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"3980","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1476817213","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.f5kbq4w","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2t274v2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/fjvc2w6.jpg","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png","full_name":"Steve Hawkins","created_by":"Steve Hawkins","private_link":"0788C71C914F3E0BD35D80848936A3C2","original_img":"1","username":"steve-hawkins","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":234399,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[{"protocol_name":"Lysate Preparation from Biofluids\/Viruses","protocol_name_html":"Lysate Preparation from Biofluids\/Viruses","protocol_id":"3971","version_id":"0","last_modified":"1510247633","link":"http:\/\/www.bioline.com\/us\/downloads\/dl\/file\/id\/3789\/isolate_ii_biofluids_rna_kit_product_manual.pdf","fork_id":null,"number_of_steps":"4","vendor_id":"1","downloads":"0","views":"29","uri":"lysate-preparation-from-biofluids-viruses-f5bbq2n","description":"<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 12\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">The steps for preparing the lysate are different depending on the starting material.
