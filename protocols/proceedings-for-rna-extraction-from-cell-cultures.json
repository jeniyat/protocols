Prior to any manipulation, the bench and micropipettes must be cleaned with ethanol 70%. Always use powder-free gloves and clean them constantly along the procedure with ethanol 70%. In addition, every material used (tubes, tips, etc) must be RNAse-free or DEPC treated. The solvents and solutions used must be also opened into exhaust hood and aliquot in flasks rinsed with DEPC and autoclaved.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final yield after the extraction process varies according to the cell type, i.e., the initial amount of cells must be optimized taking into account which cell type in use and the necessary amount for subsequent use of the extracted RNA. Lineage cells use to provide greater RNA yield than primary cells. Follows some examples as parameters: For further qPCR analyzes, it uses to be achieved enough yield when extracting RNA from 100 thousand Schwann cells from lineage ST8814, 200 thousand monocyte cells from lineage THP-1 or 1 million monocyte cells from PBMC.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><u>Experimental proceedings:<\/u><\/p>\n<p><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the supernatant from the cultures and add 500 \u00b5L TRIzol reagent to the monolayer in order to lyse the cells.
