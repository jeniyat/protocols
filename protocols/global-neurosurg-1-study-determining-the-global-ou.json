We will test the differences between HDI tertiles by using the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variable and Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for continuous variables. Binary logistic regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate the predictors of 30-day mortality. The odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each variable. First, variables from the univariate analysis with P\u02c20.05 will be selected for inclusion in the multivariate model. Then variables that are independently contributing to the mortality will be selected and examined. All analyses will be conducted by STATA software (version 15) for windows.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ethics and dissemination<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Study ethical approval will be acquired from all participating centers.
