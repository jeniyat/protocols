Standard assays were used according to the manufac- turer\u2019s recommendations: EXTEM (ref.: 503-05, Tem International GmbH c\/o Dutch Affiliate, Til- burg, The Netherlands), FIBTEM (ref.: 503-06, Tem International GmbH c\/o Dutch Affiliate, Til- burg, The Netherlands), and HEPTEM (ref.: 503-09, Tem International GmbH c\/o Dutch Affiliate, Tilburg, The Netherlands). All samples were measured within 1 h after blood collection. Further- more, by means of EXTEM and FIBTEM results, the contribution of platelet count to the thrombus formation was calculated as the PLTEM parameter [22].<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8513","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1509542777","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium.,Synapse Research Institute, Maastricht, The Netherlands.,Department of Surgery, ZOL, Genk, Belgium.,Department of Hepatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325000, China.,Central Diagnostic Laboratory,ZOL, Genk, Belgium.,Department of Anesthesiology, ICU and Perioperative Medicine,HMC, Doha,Qatar","affiliation":"Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine and Pain Therapy, ZOL, Genk, Belgium","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ki9cuh6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Sven-y2v284w2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ps4h8ae.jpg","full_name":"Sven Van Poucke","created_by":"Sven Van Poucke","private_link":"1FCB578FE8F1007FA90B1E0D65861EBA","original_img":"1","username":"sven-van-poucke","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0193657","manuscript_citation":"Poucke SV,  Huskens D,  Speeten KVd,  Roest M,  Lauwereins B,  Zheng M,  Dehaene S,  Penders J,  Marcus A,  Lanc\u00e9 M (2018) Thrombin generation and platelet activation in cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy - A prospective cohort study.
