In a modified version, the protocol is used to measure BiTE\u00ae-mediated bystander killing. Mixtures of human EGFR-positive (unlabeled) and EGFR-negative (luciferase-labeled) cells are implanted in nude mice along with human T cells. Mice are treated daily with BiTE\u00ae, beginning one\u00a0day after tumor implant\u00a0for 20 days. Growth of EGFR-negative cells is measured by imaging (luminescence) and by calipers (tumor volume).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"6022","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1495474978","protocol_affiliation":"Amgen Inc.","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.h5eb83e","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2y284w2t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/006.png","full_name":"Sandra Ross","created_by":"Sandra Ross","private_link":"EDC4271A53F5F32BE69274E9CFA1C363","original_img":"1","username":"sandra-ross","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0183390","manuscript_citation":"Ross SL,  Sherman M,  McElroy PL,  Lofgren JA,  Moody G,  Baeuerle PA,  Coxon A,  Arvedson T, Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibody constructs can mediate bystander tumor cell killing.
