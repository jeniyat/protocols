But for measuring total phosphorus-phosphate, condensed phosphate and, organically bound phosphate need to be digested to orthophosphate prior to the final procedure.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"4324","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1479760139","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ggcbtsw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2238423p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/005.png","full_name":"Ferdous Nawar","created_by":"Ferdous Nawar","private_link":"085B362DAF79F9128FAFEE627B1E9C4B","original_img":"1","username":"ferdous-nawar","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":233666,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"264","group_uri":"parfreylab","group_name":"ParfreyLab","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/gqpewqn.png","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"","authors_list":[],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/005.png","username":"ferdous-nawar","full_name":"Ferdous Nawar","created_by":"Ferdous Nawar"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"191630","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"227BC9DBD0914643BEA93EB949C18B36","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1479761616","components":[{"component_id":"234375","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"E053AC04398647ACAFE9D3816281051F","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">List of the Equipment:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.
