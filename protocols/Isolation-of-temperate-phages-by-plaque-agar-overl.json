For example, we isolated a pseudotemperate phage (\u03c6HSIC) and its host from the same bacterial\/viral concentrate (Jiang et al. 1998) that we obtained in the Sand Island Channel, Oahu, HI, USA. The host was first isolated by standard isolation streaking on marine agar using inoculum from a microbial population concentrate.
