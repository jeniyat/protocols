This is an ecological study of a cross-sectional cohort and time series of deaths from uterine cancer that were recorded on the death certificates of 147 women residing in Maring\u00e1-PR from 2004 to 2014. Deaths attributed to malignant neoplasms of the cervix, unspecified (C53.9) were the most common among these women. There was an increasing trend in mortality rates from cancer of the uterus. The behavior of age groups showed an increase in women over 65 years of age. Overall, 71.5% of the women had less than 8 years of education, and 60.5% had no partner. It was also found that the health unit in Vardelina had the highest number of deaths, corresponding to 0.73% of the population. The percentage of the total deaths in the city was 0.15%. These data indicate that women in lower social strata have less access to health services and less information regarding primary prevention and the effective treatment of uterine cancer.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7962","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1506180527","protocol_affiliation":"Adriana C.
