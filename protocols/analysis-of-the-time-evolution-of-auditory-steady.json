Audiological tests based on the acquisition of ASSR are useful for estimating the hearing sensitivity, mainly because multiple hearing frequencies can be simultaneously assessed, and the auditory response can be objectively detected using statistical tests. Typically, the extraction of the auditory response from the measured signal essentially relies on averaging epochs of the EEG, time-locked to the stimulus. Such a manipulation assumes that the auditory response is steady over time and that averaging increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement. Since the time-domain averaging of epochs within a recording does not allow to discriminate between methodological and physiological related variations in the amplitude of the ASSR, we designed a protocol for analyzing the dynamics of the auditory response during the acquisition procedure. The protocol allows us to compute the ASSR amplitude at a given time window without being compromised by those computed in the preceding EEG segments. In other words, the ASSR amplitudes are extracted from individual epochs, without those epochs being time-domain averaged with the preceding EEG segments. As a result, adaptation and other non-stationary behaviors of the ASSR can be studied. <\/div><\/div><\/div>"}
