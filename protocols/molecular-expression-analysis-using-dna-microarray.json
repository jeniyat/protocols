Predicting pCR will contribute to the therapeutic strategy and the prevention of surgical invasion. However, a predictor of pCR after NAC-DCF has not yet been developed. The aim of this study was to identify a novel predictor of pCR in locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with NAC-DCF.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Patients and Methods<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A total of 32 patients who received NAC-DCF followed by esophagectomy between June 2013 and March 2016 were enrolled in this study. We divided the patients into the following 2 groups: pCR group (9 cases) and non-pCR group (23 cases), and compared gene expressions between these groups using DNA microarray data and KeyMolnet. Subsequently, a validation study of candidate molecular expression was performed in 7 additional cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Seventeen molecules, including transcription factor E2F, T-cell-specific transcription factor, Src (known as \u201cproto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase of sarcoma\u201d), interferon regulatory factor 1, thymidylate synthase, cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK, caspase-1, vitamin D receptor, histone deacetylase, MAPK\/ERK kinase, bcl-2-associated X protein, runt-related transcription factor 1, PR domain zinc finger protein 1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and interleukin 1, were identified as candidate molecules. The molecules were mainly associated with pathways, such as transcriptional regulation by SMAD, RB\/E2F, and STAT. The validation study indicated that 12 of the 17 molecules (71%) matched the trends of molecular expression.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A 17-molecule set that predicts pCR after NAC-DCF for locally advanced esophageal cancer was identified.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8245","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1507973890","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Gastroenterological and Pediatric Surgery, Oita University Faculty of Medicine,Department of Surgery, Oita Nakamura Hospital","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kavcse6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2t2c413r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","full_name":"Hajime Fujishima","created_by":"Hajime Fujishima","private_link":"8A06B7A1B7ECB7870A1811B81E013D1A","original_img":"1","username":"hajime-fujishima","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>A 17-molecule set as a predictor of complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil in esophageal cancer<\/p>","journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":266298,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"1","collections":[],"tags":[{"tag_id":"1115","tag_name":"DNA microarray"},{"tag_id":"1116","tag_name":"esophageal cancer"},{"tag_id":"1117","tag_name":"molecular network"}],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Hajime Fujishima,Shoichi Fumoto,Tsuyoshi Etoh,Masafumi Inomata","authors_list":[{"name":"Hajime Fujishima","affiliation":"Department of Gastroenterological and Pediatric Surgery, Oita University Faculty of Medicine","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Shoichi Fumoto","affiliation":"Department of Surgery, Oita Nakamura Hospital","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Etoh","affiliation":"Department of Gastroenterological and Pediatric Surgery, Oita University Faculty of Medicine","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Masafumi Inomata","affiliation":"Department of Gastroenterological and Pediatric Surgery, Oita University Faculty of Medicine","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","username":"hajime-fujishima","full_name":"Hajime Fujishima","created_by":"Hajime Fujishima"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"590726","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"7DA0A4A85A114CCDA6CF4C291EA5EACA","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1507974637","components":[{"component_id":"1012299","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"6C30B1607EC5432AA6491B64FC217DA3","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<ol>\n<li><strong>Preparation of RNA and DNA<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Frozen specimens were homogenized, and total RNA was extracted using QIAamp<sup>TM<\/sup> DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and QIAGEN RNeasy<sup>TM<\/sup> mini kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol.
