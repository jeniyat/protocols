Our optimized linker amplification method requires as little as 1 pg of DNA and is the most precise and accurate available, with amplification biases less than 1.5-fold, even for complex samples as diverse as a wild virus community. While optimized here for 454 sequencing, this linker amplification method can be used to prepare metagenomics libraries for sequencing with next-generation platforms, including Illumina and Ion Torrent.<br \/><br \/>Adapted from the Broad&rsquo;s LASL Sanger Seq&rsquo;g Protocol, and optimized for low template work.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"1049","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1435871811","protocol_affiliation":"Matthew Sullivan Lab, University of Arizona\/Ohio State University","affiliation":"University of Arizona","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.c9zz75","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"VERVE-w2w29413x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bvfdk3e.jpg","full_name":"VERVE Team","created_by":"VERVE Team","private_link":"F75EDD329ABA58DCBF9AC18130CF55C1","original_img":"1","username":"verve-team","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"1","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":224012,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"45","group_uri":"verve-net","group_name":"VERVE Net","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/cdqcwwe.png","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"},{"group_id":"50","group_uri":"sullivan-lab","group_name":"Sullivan Lab","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/fxc3an.jpg","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"1","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Bonnie Poulos, Melissa Duhaime, Li Deng","authors_list":[{"name":"Bonnie Poulos","affiliation":"Matthew Sullivan Lab, University of Arizona\/Ohio State University","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":" Melissa Duhaime","affiliation":"Matthew Sullivan Lab, University of Arizona\/Ohio State University","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":" Li Deng","affiliation":"Matthew Sullivan Lab, University of Arizona\/Ohio State University","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bvfdk3e.jpg","username":"verve-team","full_name":"VERVE Team","created_by":"VERVE Team"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"<strong>Ultrasonic shearing of DNA<\/strong> <br \/>Samples in 1x TE, pH 7.5, &lt;5 \u00b5g in 130 \u00b5l.
