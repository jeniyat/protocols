The parameters calculated from repeated measurements can be user for reliability analysis of certain center of pressure parameters used to describe postural control and balancing capability. The guidelines are based on recommendations of the literature. It is important to be consistent during all the measurements and follow the guidelines as they regulate important aspects of the measurements.
