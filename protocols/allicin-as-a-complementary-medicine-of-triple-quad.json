A funnel plot may be adopted to evaluate the publication bias. The meta-analysis may be performed using fixed effect model for low heterogeneity and randomized effect model for high heterogeneity. Publication bias will be evaluated by Egger\u2019s test, and funnel plot as well if enough (n>10) studies are included. What\u2019s more, Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) will be performed to evaluate whether the required information size has been met in order to make a determination of treatment benefit, harm or futility. The results of the meta-analysis will also be evaluated using the GRADE method and whether degradation is considered in terms of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, accuracy, and publication bias, divided into \u201chigh quality\u201d, \u201cmoderate quality\u201d, \u201clow quality\u201d, and \u201cvery low quality\u201d. <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusions: <\/span><span>Our review will provide an evidence of moderate quality that allicin as a complementary medicine for Helicobacter pylori.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> \u0014<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1561826201}
