Carefully retract the left mandibular gland using an elastic stay hook and tape the hook to the surgery table.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7.  Locate the carotid artery along the left side of the trachea using sterile cotton tip applicators. Using fine tipped, curved forceps, carefully isolate the vessel from the surrounding tissue, making sure not to disturb the vagus nerve.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">8.  Pass three pieces of 5-0 or 6-0 non-absorbable suture underneath the isolated artery section. The furthest cranial suture will be used to permanently ligate the carotid artery while the suture closer to the heart will be used to temporarily occlude blood flow to allow for placement of the catheter. The middle suture will be used to hold the catheter in place after cannulation of the artery.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">9.  Position the ligation suture just proximal to the bifurcation of the interior and exterior carotid arteries. Tie a secure knot around the artery to ligate the vessel and tape the suture tails to the surgery table.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">10. Make a loose knot in both the occlusion suture and the middle suture and position them as close to the clavicle as possible thus isolating at least 6 mm of the artery.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\n11. After making a loose knot in both pieces of suture, clamp a hemostat on one of the tails of the middle suture.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\n12. Remove the transmitter from the sterile package and transfer it to the sterile field. Do not handle the transmitter by grasping the catheter. This may cause damage to the catheter or the pressure sensor.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">13. Turn the AM radio on and carefully remove the tip cover. Removal of the tip cover should be done by alternating gentle traction and release. Take care to prevent gel loss due to compression of the catheter or sudden release of the tip cover. Always examine the catheter under high magnification before implantation for gel loss or bubbles. If there is gel loss or bubbles, the catheter will need to be re-gelled.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">14. Prepare a catheter introducer by bending the beveled tip of a 25-gauge syringe needle. Hold the syringe needle with the beveled side facing up. Grasp just the beveled area of the needle with a needle holder and bend the tip downward to an angle of approximately 90\u00b0. The syringe needle may be placed onto a 1 cc syringe to be used as a handle to hold onto the needle and allow for a clear view of the surgical area.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">15. Gently apply tension to the occlusion suture closest to the clavicle using a hemostat. This will elevate the artery and occlude blood flow. Caution: Excessive tension can damage the artery.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">16. Grasp the tip of the catheter just distal to the thin-walled section using a Vessel Cannulation Forceps.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">17. Using the 25-gauge needle as an introducer, pierce the artery just proximal to the ligation suture and insert the catheter upstream toward the aorta. Once the catheter is inserted into the vessel, withdraw the catheter introducer.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">18. Advance the catheter into the artery until it reaches the occlusion suture.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">19. Position the middle suture around the artery and catheter. Secure the catheter by pulling the loose suture tail to tighten the knot. Releasing the catheter before it is secured may cause it to come out of the vessel.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">20. Once the catheter is secured, release the tension on the occlusion suture and advance the catheter beyond the suture into the thoracic cavity.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\n21. Continue to advance the catheter so that at least 2 mm of the sensing region of the catheter is positioned in the aortic arch.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">22. Tighten the occlusion suture and the middle suture around the artery and catheter to seal the artery wall around the catheter stem.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">23. Release the tension on the ligation suture and tie the loose ends around the catheter stem to help anchor it in place.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">24. Trim all suture tails as short as possible. A very small drop of Vetbond tissue adhesive may be applied only to the suture knots to ensure that they remain secure. A gel-loading micropipette tip is recommended to dispense the tissue adhesive.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":711277,"guid":"D71158A0360711E9AF50B7833F4CC32D","previous_id":711273,"previous_guid":"36E323F0360611E9AD3ABF9B102F5AA4","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"0530B66616C0429681043448B89DAC88","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"0768BBC9B19640A3B9C0308BDD072E44","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Subcutaneous Device Placement<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>1.<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><span>Insert small surgical scissors into the incision and form a subcutaneous pocket by using blunt dissection.

telemetry we have the ability to simultaneously measure a pressure signal and biopotential signal (ECG, EEG, EMG) in a single mouse. This can provide a more comprehensive physiological assessment of cardiovascular function, the presence of any damage to the heart, the effects of drugs, specific genes or interventions used to regulate the heart.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Modified from:<\/span><span> Butz et al.
