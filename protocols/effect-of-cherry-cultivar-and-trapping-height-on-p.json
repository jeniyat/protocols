In this study, we examined the species composition and dynamics of fruit flies in cherry orchards by lure traps placed \u00a0at different heights, and in three different cherry cultivars\u00a0from April through September, between 2014-2016\u00a0in Qingdao, Shandong Province. The total number of fruit flies increased year by year.\u00a0Four species were captured: <em>Drosophila melanogaster <\/em>Meigen, <em>D<\/em><em>.<\/em><em>\u00a0suzukii <\/em>Matsumura, <em>D<\/em><em>.<\/em><em>\u00a0hydei <\/em>Sturtevant,<em>\u00a0<\/em>and <em>D<\/em><em>.<\/em><em>\u00a0immigrans<\/em>\u00a0Sturtevant. The dominant species was<em>\u00a0D. melanogaster, <\/em>being 66.7% of the total, followed by<em>\u00a0D. suzukii <\/em>Matsumura (29.7%). <em>D. hydei <\/em>and <em>D. immigrans <\/em>accounted for 3.0 and 0.6%, and for these last two species, no peak period of abundance was observed. In general, drosophilid fruit flies appeeraed in\u00a0April, and peaked\u00a0around mid-July. Over the three years of the study, peak fruit fly abundance was later each year, being at the end of June in 2014, and in the middle of July in 2015 and 2016. There were significant differences in the number of<em>\u00a0Drosophila<\/em>\u00a0species among cherry cultivars\u00a0as well asin the number of <em>Drosophila<\/em>\u00a0trapped at different heights.\u00a0The optimal height for trap placement was at 1m above ground level, which is recommended as a standard height for monitoring trap placement.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9166","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1512909579","protocol_affiliation":"13655423193@163.com","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.k7nczme","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2x244z2y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","full_name":"Man Xiao ming","created_by":"Man Xiao ming","private_link":"30C21CD268C1C4B8C677B141047113CC","original_img":"1","username":"man-xiao-ming","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p><strong>Arn\u00f3, S., and R.
