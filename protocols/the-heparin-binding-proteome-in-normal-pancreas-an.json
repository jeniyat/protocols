style = \"text-align:justify\">Acute pancreatitis (AP) is acute inflammation of the pancreas, mainly caused by gallstones and alcohol, driven by changes in communication between cells. Heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) play a central role in cell communication. Therefore, we used heparin affinity proteomics to identify extracellular HBPs in pancreas and plasma of normal mice and in a caerulein mouse model of AP. Many new extracellular HBPs (360) were discovered in the pancreas, taking the total number of HBPs known to 786. Extracellular pancreas HBPs form highly interconnected protein-protein interaction networks in both normal pancreas (NP) and AP. Thus, HBPs represent an important set of extracellular proteins with significant regulatory potential in the pancreas. HBPs in NP are associated with biological functions such as molecular transport and cellular movement that underlie pancreatic homeostasis. However, in AP HBPs are associated with additional processes such as acute phase response signalling, complement activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Plasma HBPs in AP included known AP biomarkers such as serum amyloid A, as well as emerging targets such as histone H2A. Pancreas HBPs are extracellular and so easily accessible and are potential drug targets in AP, whereas plasma HBPs represent potential biomarkers for AP. These need further investigation for potential applications in the management of AP.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}
