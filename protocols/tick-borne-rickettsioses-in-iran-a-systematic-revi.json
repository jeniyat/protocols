Rickettsiae infect and multiply in most organs of ticks, particularly the salivary glands thus enabling pathogen transmission to a variety of hosts among them mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Although many animals (mammals and birds) are susceptible to rickettsial infections and may develop rickettsemia and clinical signs, the role of vertebrates as reservoirs in maintaining zoonotic foci is yet to be fully determined (Raoult and Roux, 1997). Humans do not appear to be reservoirs of tick-borne rickettsiae, because they are only occasionally parasitized by ticks and they are rickettsemic for only short periods (Raoult and Roux, 1997).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Only Ixodid ticks have been implicated as diseases vectors, and rickettsiae are known to be maintained in these ticks by transstadial and transovarial transmission (Raoult and Roux, 1997). Ticks are currently considered second only to mosquitoes as vectors of human infectious diseases in the world. Each tick species has preferred environmental conditions and biotopes that determine its geographic distribution and consequently the risk areas for tick-borne diseases. Tick-borne diseases are therefore geographically localized and occur mostly in foci with optimal conditions. As such, there are many natural foci of rickettsial diseases in Iran from which they may spread to other areas under changing socio-economic and climatic conditions, thus posing a public health concern in Iran (Rahbari <em>et al.,<\/em> 2007). The disease is responsible for a substantial health and economic burden, particularly to low-income countries. People in close contact with domestic animals and their products like farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, laboratory personnel, health care workers are at higher risk of tick-borne rickettsioses. In humans, the disease usually presents as an acute, sometimes fatal febrile syndrome characterized by headache, chills, myalgias, arthralgia, malaise and hematological abnormalities, such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels (Bakken <em>et al<\/em>., 1996).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Quantitative epidemiology can provide important information to improve the understanding of the parasite transmission and hence is an important part of efforts to control the disease. In Iran, a significant proportion of human infectious diseases are tick-borne among them rickettsioses, yet tick-borne rickettsioses have not received the level of public attention that has been paid to other maladies, largely because their presence or the true magnitude of their occurrence is still under reported. Only a few epidemiological studies of ricketssioses having been conducted yet anecdotal evidence suggest that tick-borne rickettsioses are widespread but underreported in the country.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why it is important to do this review<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Epidemiological review can provide important information to improve the understanding of the diseases transmission and hence is an important part of efforts to control the disease.

Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed using a three-stage approach through reviewing the title, abstract and full text by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review. The systematic review will be guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) checklist (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Although a meta-analysis is planned this will only become apparent when we see what data is extracted and made available from the systematic review.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Risk of bias<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This review may present some limitations with regards to missing publications, language bias and publication bias. The combination of terms that will be entered in each individual search will be aimed at retrieving as many relevant publications as possible but at the same time try to narrow the amount of results. Hence, it is highly possible that relevant research articles, which will not contain in their titles or abstracts the key words used in our search, may be overlooked. In addition, some of the articles that will be retrieved may not be written in English and will therefore be excluded from the review, indicating a major bias towards English publications. Furthermore, all the selected publications will be obtained through electronic search, thus we acknowledge a bias towards articles published online. Most of the studies to be included in this review are likely to be cross-sectional studies reporting on tick-borne rickettsioses in a number of organisms at a specific point in time. These types of studies can be subjected to selection and information bias. Common sources of potential bias in tick-borne rickettsioses studies included the selection of sampled organisms or animals being based just on availability (e.g. domestic animals).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Measures of Effect Size<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Analysis of the effect size will be based on the number of studies and their reported outcomes.
