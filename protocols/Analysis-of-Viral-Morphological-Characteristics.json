&nbsp; a) no skipping viruses because they are ugly (no bias!) <br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; b) the pictures do not have to be works of art (this is &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo;) so take them as fast as you can and just make sure that you will be able to get accurate measurements of them later (e.g. they should be in focus, but don&rsquo;t take 5 minutes to obtain the perfect focus and lighting) <br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; c) take all pictures at the same magnification (110,000X generally works) because this will make it much easier to analyze them later <br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; d) if you are unsure if something is a virus, take a picture of it anyway, but do not count it as part of the 100 viruses (ask knowledgeable colleagues for help later) <br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; e) take pictures of anything else that is cool or interesting (it&rsquo;s a digital camera &ndash; no limits) <br \/><br \/>3) Make sure that each micrograph has a scale bar <br \/><br \/>4) Save each micrograph as follows: &ldquo;Box-Grid-Virus number&rdquo;, e.g. 1-2b-37 <br \/><br \/>5) Once you have the micrographs, analyze them with ImageJ analysis software <br \/>&nbsp;
