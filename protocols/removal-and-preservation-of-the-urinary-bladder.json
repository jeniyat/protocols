(Fig. D) When empty it collapses. It is easily picked up by holding into its dome (cephalled) or <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">to the urethra (caudal) by a pair of pick up. For tissue preparation, please follow the below steps: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1. While the bladder is being equilibrated in physiological buffer (Krebs\u2019 solution) for at least 10 min, label the <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    containers: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     a. surgical pathology cassettes X 2; <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     b. a secure container (centrifuge tube) to hold 40-50 ml Krebs\u2019 solution at 4\u00b0C <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     c. micro centrifuge tubes X2 <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     d. Crymold <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2. Make sure the bladder\u2019s weight is recorded. If not, do it NOW and record it. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3. While soaked in Kreb\u2019s solution, place the bladder on a hard surface <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4. Using a sharp straight blade, cut the bladder into half at its equatorial line. Avoid chain sawing it by using a sharp <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    fresh blade. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>5. Using a sharp blade, slice a full circumference section of the bladder from the <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">upper half<\/span><span> (cephalled portion) with <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">    minimal width of 3 mm<\/span><span>. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">6. Place the slice obtained from step 4 into a tube containing 40-50 ml Krebs\u2019 solution (4\u00b0C). This tissue will be used for <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>    contractility studies and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">should be arrived at our lab within 24 hours<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7. Place the remaining cephalled portion of the bladder in 4\u00b0C phosphatebuffered saline solution for preparation for the <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    next step (Step 13) . <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>8. Using a sharp blade, slice a full circumference section of the bladder from the <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">lower half<\/span><span> (caudal) with minimal width <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    of 3 mm. Place this section in 10% neutral buffered formalin (pH 7.0) in a surgical cassette in room temperature. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    Make sure the circular orientation of the section of the bladder is preserved in the cassette. This specimen will be <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    used for histological studies. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">9. Place the remaining of the lower half (caudal) into the crymold upside down to preserve its anatomical orientation. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    Use OCT compound to bind tissue to the specimen block and to surround and cover the entire tissue specimen with <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    OCT compound. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">10. Snap-freeze the specimen in the OCT compound with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00baC. This tissue will be used <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">       for immunohistochemical studies. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>11.<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\"> Take a deep breath! And get ready for the next step. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">12. Now you need to separate the urothelium from the muscle of the bladder. The urothelium is loosely attached to the <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">       underlying muscle (detrusor). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>13. Pin the remaining of the bladder at its four corner to a hard surface. <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Use of dissecting microscope or magnifying <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">      lens is very helpful for the next step. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">14. Lift up the urothelium with your microdissectig pick up. Push the tips of the microdissecting scissors into the space <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">       plane between two layers, while lifting the urothelium. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">15. Open the jaws of the scissors while in the plane. This will create an expanded plane between two layers. By <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">       repeating this step, you could separate most of the urothelium from the muscle. Occasionally you need to cut the <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">       attachments between two layers. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">16. Put urothelium and the muscle into different microcentriguge tubes. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">17. Freeze both samples in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C.
