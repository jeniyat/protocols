(Fig. D) When empty it collapses. It is easily picked up by holding into its dome (cephalled) or to the urethra (caudal) by a pair of pick up. For tissue preparation, please follow the below steps: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1. While the bladder is being equilibrated in physiological buffer (Krebs\u2019 solution) for at least 10 min, label the <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    containers: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     a. surgical pathology cassettes X 2; <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     b. a secure container (centrifuge tube) to hold 40-50 ml Krebs\u2019 solution at 4\u00b0C <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     c. micro centrifuge tubes X2 <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     d. Crymold <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2. Make sure the bladder\u2019s weight is recorded. If not, do it NOW and record it. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3. While soaked in Kreb\u2019s solution, place the bladder on a hard surface <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4. Using a sharp straight blade, cut the bladder into half at its equatorial line. Avoid chain sawing it by using a sharp fresh blade. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>5. Using a sharp blade, slice a full circumference section of the bladder from the <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">upper half<\/span><span> (cephalled portion) with <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">minimal width of 3 mm<\/span><span>. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>6. Place the slice obtained from step 4 into a tube containing 40-50 ml Krebs\u2019 solution (4\u00b0C). This tissue will be used for contractility studies and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">should be arrived at our lab within 24 hours<\/span><span>.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7. Place the remaining cephalled portion of the bladder in 4\u00b0C phosphatebuffered saline solution for preparation for the next step (Step 13) . <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>8. Using a sharp blade, slice a full circumference section of the bladder from the <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">lower half<\/span><span> (caudal) with minimal width of 3 mm. Place this section in 10% neutral buffered formalin (pH 7.0) in a surgical cassette in room temperature. Make sure the circular orientation of the section of the bladder is preserved in the cassette. This specimen will be used for histological studies. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">9. Place the remaining of the lower half (caudal) into the crymold upside down to preserve its anatomical orientation. Use OCT compound to bind tissue to the specimen block and to surround and cover the entire tissue specimen with OCT compound. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">10. Snap-freeze the specimen in the OCT compound with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00baC. This tissue will be used for immunohistochemical studies. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>11.<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\"> Take a deep breath! And get ready for the next step. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">12. Now you need to separate the urothelium from the muscle of the bladder. The urothelium is loosely attached to the underlying muscle (detrusor). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>13. Pin the remaining of the bladder at its four corner to a hard surface. <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Use of dissecting microscope or magnifying lens is very helpful for the next step. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">14. Lift up the urothelium with your microdissectig pick up. Push the tips of the microdissecting scissors into the space plane between two layers, while lifting the urothelium. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">15. Open the jaws of the scissors while in the plane. This will create an expanded plane between two layers. By repeating this step, you could separate most of the urothelium from the muscle. Occasionally you need to cut the attachments between two layers. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">16. Put urothelium and the muscle into different microcentriguge tubes. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">17. Freeze both samples in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C.
