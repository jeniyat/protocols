Analytic method research and development are increasingly valued. Recent literature on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.creative-biolabs.com\/adc\/classify-adc-linkers-7.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> ADC characterization<\/a>, biodistribution, metabolism, and elimination can be found in the importance of research and development of antibody drugs, particularly ADC drugs. Biological analysis of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creative-biolabs.com\/adc\/services.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ADCs <\/a>is challenging compared to small molecule drugs and protein therapies because ADCs have a complex molecular structure that has the molecular characteristics of combining small molecule drugs with protein therapies. The ADC runs from the serum or plasma to the site of action or to the target cell. Under the action of the enzyme, the antibody-linker-active drug is cleaved to release the drug and produce a therapeutic effect. For this novel drug action method, the bioanalytical method must take into account the antibody-linker-active drug, and it needs to be specially designed for this complex ADC delivery system to provide more and more complete pharmacokinetic information, but cannot be achieved by traditional biological analysis methods.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"13423","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1530155605","protocol_affiliation":"Creative Bioabs","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.rcpd2vn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"43237403v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/2hj2jae.jpg","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Bella Smith","created_by":"Bella Smith","private_link":"0B341B47BE93EDBDD6CDDB09815E1F6C","original_img":"1","username":"bella-smith1","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":326775,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"ADC manufacturing,ADC characterization,ADC linkers","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"big_protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/2hi2jae.jpg","big_protocol_img_ofn":"biolabs-logo-6-23-\u7070\u8272-1.jpg","is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Bella Smith","authors_list":[{"name":"Bella Smith","affiliation":"Creative Bioabs","username":"bella-smith1","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","username":"bella-smith1","full_name":"Bella Smith","created_by":"Bella Smith"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"0","status_info":"We use this document in our group and it is working","steps":[]}
