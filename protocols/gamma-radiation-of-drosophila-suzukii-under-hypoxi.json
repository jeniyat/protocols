Treating insects with a lower oxygen atmosphere before and during exposure to radiation can mitigate some of the negative physiological effects due to the irradiation. The irradiation of pupae under the oxygen-reduced environments such as hypoxia is routinely used in the SIT operational programs of some tephritid species as it provides radiological protection. This treatment allows to have the sterile pupae already in sealed containers to facilitate their shipment. Therefore, it is crucial to study the effects of irradiation on the reproductive sterility in<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\"> D. suzukii <\/span><span>males and females under low-oxygen atmosphere (hypoxia) compare to normal oxygen level conditions (normoxia). <\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span>This protocol describes step-by-step the irradiation of <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">D. suzukii <\/span><span>pupae under hypoxia and normoxia atmosphere conditions.
