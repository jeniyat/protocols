Genome Hi-C scaffolding resulted in 19 chromosomes containing 99.35% of bases of the assembled genome. Genome annotation revealed that a considerable part of the genome (46.1%) is composed by repeated sequences, while 24,045 protein-coding genes were predicted and 84.7% of them were annotated.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><span>: We report here the chromosomal-level assembly of the <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. broughtonii<\/span><span> genome based on long read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding. The genomic data could be served as reference genome for the Arcidae Family and will provide a valuable resource for the scientific community and aquaculture sector.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1555859589}
