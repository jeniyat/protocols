All of the analyses done for the 1KP capstone, and previous studies on subsets of these data, are based on a series of de novo transcriptome assemblies and related outputs that will be described in this publication. We expect that these data will also be useful to other researchers with interests in specific gene families, either across the green plant tree of life or in more focused lineages. These protocols provide additional details on the sample and sequence processing, hopefully providing insight for reproducibility and tools for other researchers working on plant transcriptomics and evolution.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1565936035}
