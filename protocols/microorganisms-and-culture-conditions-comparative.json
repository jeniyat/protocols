Here, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis between four strains of <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. aureus<\/span><span> causing subclinical infection (Sau170, 302, 1269, 1364), previously sequenced by our group, and two well-characterized strains causing clinical mastitis (N305 and RF122) to find differences that could be linked to mastitis outcome. A total of 146 virulence-associated genes were compared and no appreciable differences were found between the bacteria. However, several nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in genes present in the subclinical strains when compared to RF122, especially in genes encoding host immune evasion and surface proteins. The comparison of orthologous genes using OrthoMCL identified a membrane transporter in the genomes of the bacteria belonging to the subclinical group, but this finding was not confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a collection of field isolates of <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. aureus<\/span><span> associated with clinical or subclinical mastits. The secreted and surface proteins predicted by different in silico tools were compared through multidimensional scaling analysis, revealing a high degree of similarity among the six strains. However, differences were seen in the nucleotide sequences of a gene that codes for a hypothetical protein (cl3309) and a lipoprotein (cl3700). These findings were also analyzed by PCR on DNA extracted from field isolates of<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\"> S. aureus<\/span><span>. The lipoprotein, but not the hypothetical protein, was able to separate the clinical isolates from the subclinical ones.
