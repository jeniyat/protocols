Extraction and analysis of proteins from adipose tissue is increasingly important for understanding many physiological\/pathological conditions. However, due to the high fat and low protein content in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), it is technically challenging.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">It is well known that water-oil emulsions in biological samples are the most difficult to separate, and the pore-sized centrifugal column with unique surface properties and the optimized surfactant-free buffer system can quickly and efficiently emulsify water oil from adipose tissue homogenate. The extraction buffer is lower than the oil freezing point in the adipose tissue, and the adipose tissue homogenate can quickly separate the aqueous phase and the oil phase through the centrifugal column, and the total protein in the tissue is not lost. Protein yields can reach 2-3 mg\/ml, which is much higher than other methods.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Collected by <\/span><a style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Creative BioMart<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1546926964}
