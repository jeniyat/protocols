For any experiment, testing should take place during the same 2-3 hour period on each day. Morning or afternoon testing at least one hour prior to dark cycle onset are appropriate. Testing after \u201clights out\u201d in the vivarium is not appropriate.

The caging used for the study should be standardized and reported with the data.
