This allows mice to recover from the surgery prior to the potential stress of AngII infusion. If a second pump is needed to continuously infuse AngII after removal of the first pump, it must ensure that pumping has already started before the surgery. This requires that pumps are incubated in sterile saline at 37 \u00baC for &gt; 40 hours (for Alzet 2004).<\/li>\n<\/ol>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"961801","previous_id":"961800","original_id":"0","guid":"9CE132AE5753400E93F9139BE9ACE1D6","previous_guid":"E2E4EFC84E5D4C309C615C22E4D81E25","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Osmotic Pump Filling","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Osmotic Pump Filling"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"579454","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"85AFD2413DBE4BED8F178222FB614105","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":null,"last_modified":"1500052523","components":[{"component_id":"961802","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"BFEA9B1EEB044AF7A513B76EF9CB3778","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>PREPARATION of ALZET Osmotic Pumps for Subcutaneous Implantation<\/p>","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>PREPARATION of ALZET Osmotic Pumps for Subcutaneous Implantation<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"961803","previous_id":"961802","original_id":"0","guid":"6346D6EA8C1745FB94DC68F727F4DCA3","previous_guid":"BFEA9B1EEB044AF7A513B76EF9CB3778","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"579455","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"971DD361A4DD4A1C847C05A869AFB47D","previous_guid":"AE737D4CAC6D4F41920BA88A9F0E01B5","previous_id":"579453","last_modified":"1500052570","components":[{"component_id":"961804","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"B7AB7468A087433084B5AB22E8C2574C","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Surgical Implantation of Mini-Osmotic &amp; Micro-Osmotic Pumps<\/p>","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Surgical Implantation of Mini-Osmotic &amp; Micro-Osmotic Pumps<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"961805","previous_id":"961804","original_id":"0","guid":"D76EA0C960B24740B9E5602DA7EA339D","previous_guid":"B7AB7468A087433084B5AB22E8C2574C","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"579456","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"EA9435481F7648229B1935C89535AAA9","previous_guid":"971DD361A4DD4A1C847C05A869AFB47D","previous_id":"579455","last_modified":"1500052632","components":[{"component_id":"961806","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"0F815874178A4B519CFC2DF956C03DD7","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<ol>\n<li>Sterile Pack: one pair of large surgical scissors, straight hemostats, forceps, 9 mm wound clip kit, drapes, cotton swabs, gauze squares<\/li>\n<li>Sterile gloves<\/li>\n<li>Surgical mask<\/li>\n<li>Yellow gown<\/li>\n<li>3 conical tubes: Betadine,70% ethanol, Sterile water.<\/li>\n<li>Pumps for implantation<\/li>\n<li>Shaving implement<\/li>\n<li>Antiseptic handrub<\/li>\n<li>Topical 4% Lidocaine<\/li>\n<li>Isoflurane vaporizer<\/li>\n<li>Induction chamber<\/li>\n<li>Nose cone<\/li>\n<li>Oxygen<\/li>\n<li>2 charcoal canisters<\/li>\n<\/ol>","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<ol>\n<li>Sterile Pack: one pair of large surgical scissors, straight hemostats, forceps, 9 mm wound clip kit, drapes, cotton swabs, gauze squares<\/li>\n<li>Sterile gloves<\/li>\n<li>Surgical mask<\/li>\n<li>Yellow gown<\/li>\n<li>3 conical tubes: Betadine,70% ethanol, Sterile water.<\/li>\n<li>Pumps for implantation<\/li>\n<li>Shaving implement<\/li>\n<li>Antiseptic handrub<\/li>\n<li>Topical 4% Lidocaine<\/li>\n<li>Isoflurane vaporizer<\/li>\n<li>Induction chamber<\/li>\n<li>Nose cone<\/li>\n<li>Oxygen<\/li>\n<li>2 charcoal canisters<\/li>\n<\/ol>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"961807","previous_id":"961806","original_id":"0","guid":"8595920F99AE434E9EE2E2DCFE3DA480","previous_guid":"0F815874178A4B519CFC2DF956C03DD7","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Equipment For Pump Implantation","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Equipment For Pump Implantation"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"579457","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"CA1C958C1FD8470F85C9C72C0E05FF93","previous_guid":"EA9435481F7648229B1935C89535AAA9","previous_id":"579456","last_modified":"1500052659","components":[{"component_id":"961808","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"A539DCD880C549FA9C683DD6CC869308","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<ol>\n<li>Put gauze and cotton swabs on a surgical drape and fold corner to corner and put an autoclave tape on it.
