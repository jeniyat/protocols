Panel B shows example of unit activity relative to left ventricular pressure. Similar analysis can be used to ID neurons that are activated by autonomic stimulation: in this case the temporal firing pattern of units is summed based from delivery of stimulation to nerve. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">-<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Significant changes in the firing rate<\/span><span>:\u201d Changes identified in neuronal activity were compared at different time windows by calculating the average firing rate over time. The significance level of the observed differences in firing rate was assessed using a statistical test recently utilized in a study of primary motor cortex neurons (Shin et al. 2010). The resulting P value is a function of four parameters: the duration of the two time windows and the number of firings in each time window.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The null hypothesis is that the two firing rates are equal. For this analysis, it is assumed that the number of action potentials identified follows a Poisson distribution in each time window and that the difference in the activities follows a Skellam distribution (Skellam, 1946; Strackee & Deneir van der Gon, 1962). Parameters can then be estimated using the maximum likelihood approach. From the Skellam cumulative distribution function, the probability that the difference in number of firings is larger than the observed value provides the desired P value (unilateral test). The test was implemented in Matlab and adapted from the R package \u2018skellam\u2019 by Jerry W. Lewis. Two significance levels were used: 1% and 5%. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The advantages of this method are its simplicity, the robustness of its parameter estimation and its applicability in the case of low firing rates, including when the firing rate is zero. Its limitations are the assumptions of stationarity and Poisson-distributed firings. In contrast with cortical neurons, neurons in the VIV ganglionated plexus tend to fire at low frequency unless a special event (e.g. ischemia) occurs. As a result, the limited number of firings in the time windows prevents robust estimation of a larger number of parameters. \u201c(Beaumont,2013)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Using this approach, we utilized a battery of different stressors to assess functional responses of the peripheral autonomic ganglia. This included touching the right (RV) and left (LV) ventricular surface, transient great vessel occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC), aorta or bilateral carotid arteries (BCA) or electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi (right or left; RCV,LCV) or stellate ganglia (right or left; RSG, LSG). Significant increases in activity are indicated below as green; significant decreases in activity are indicated below as red.

This type of analysis quantifies whether a neuron that responded to one stressor also responds to another stressor. For that purpose, a neuron was said to respond to a stressor when a significant change in its activity rate (P < 0.05; either an increase or a decrease) was observed before and during each intervention. The potential for a functional relationship between stressors X and Y was quantified within neurons identified in each subject as a conditional probability that a neuron that responded to stressor Y also responded to a stressor X. The conditional probability (Prob: response to Y | response to X) was estimated as the number of neurons that responded to both X and Y, divided by the number of neurons that responded to X.<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Neural analysis using linear micrarray electrodes.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1562957778}
