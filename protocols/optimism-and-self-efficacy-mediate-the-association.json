Two hundred and eight participants completed the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale, Life Orientation Rest-Revised, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale. Structural equation modeling results showed that optimism mediated the relationship between shyness and measures of subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect). Self-efficacy mediated the association between shyness and positive subjective well-being (life satisfaction and positive affect). These results suggest that optimism and self-efficacy play unique moderating roles in the relationship between shyness and subjective well-being. They also have important implications for the development of intervention programs aimed at promoting subjective well-being through enhancing self-efficacy and optimism.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9853","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1517033902","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mu5c6y6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2x2c4z2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/008.png","full_name":"LIU JIE","created_by":"LIU JIE","private_link":"CFECA858125B47ADB4D058C509C738DE","original_img":"1","username":"liu-jie","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0194559","manuscript_citation":"Liu C,  Cheng Y,  Hsu ASC,  Chen C,  Liu J,  Yu G (2018) Optimism and self-efficacy mediate the association between shyness and subjective well-being among Chinese working adults.
