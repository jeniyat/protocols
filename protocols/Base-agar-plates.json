This will provide a support base for the top agar\/agarose overlay as well as nutrients for the host cells. For best results, use plates within 1 week of pouring.<br \/><br \/> Tip: plates can be fast-tracked: dry plates at 37\u00b0C; leave lids slightly ajar; monitor closely to prevent over drying.<br \/><br \/><em>Considerations:<\/em> Depending on the composition of the media used, the addition of solidification agents (in particular the combination of high salinity seawater-based media and common agar such as Bacto Agar) can often result in the formation of precipitates when autoclaved together. These \u009cflocks can sometimes interfere with interpretation of the plaque assay. Moreover, impurities in common agar can negatively affect the growth of the host cells. Here are some suggestions on how to reduce the formation of these precipitates. Some testing may be required to determine the best combination to use for your particular situation. <br \/><br \/>a. Do not use common agar; rule of thumb \u0094the whiter the agar, the \u009ccleaner it is. <br \/>b. Use commercially available purified agar or agarose; or clean common agar using a washing procedure such as the one outlined in Waterbury and Willey (1989). <br \/>c. Reduce the salinity of seawater media with purified water; e.g., to 20-\u009325 psu. <br \/>d. Add purified agar or agarose to autoclaved media aseptically and then melt the agar\/agarose in the microwave (bring to a short boil 2-3 times to completely dissolve the agar\/agarose). <br \/>e. For cells that will grow in artificial media, prepare media and gelling agent at 2x concentration and autoclave separately. When cooled to ca. 60\u00b0C, gently mix the gelling agent into the media and dispense immediately. <br \/>f. In the case of artificial media, add agar\/agarose to filter-sterilized media and melt the gelling agent in the microwave","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"131383","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"1450FF93832F4FB5B9644FECDFFAD642","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1446607721","components":[{"component_id":"126871","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"9ECDBD7C147043C783B3EC1BC6C141C4","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"Add
