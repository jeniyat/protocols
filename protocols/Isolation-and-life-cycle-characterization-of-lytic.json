The procedures presented here are limited to lytic viruses infecting such hosts. In addition to the isolation procedures, methods for life cycle characterization (one-step growth experiments) of bacteriophages and cyanophages are described.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"1744","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1444075524","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.dxq7mv","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2v2b433v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","full_name":"Amy Chan","created_by":"Amy Chan","private_link":"738C668E08E0538604E3289E439B7379","original_img":"1","username":"amy-chan","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":222880,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[{"protocol_name":"Bacteriophage isolation by spotting on target host cells","protocol_name_html":"Bacteriophage isolation by spotting on target host cells","protocol_id":"1490","version_id":"0","last_modified":"1521957601","link":"http:\/\/www.aslo.org\/books\/mave\/MAVE_118.pdf","fork_id":null,"number_of_steps":"12","vendor_id":"1","downloads":"0","views":"132","uri":"Bacteriophage-isolation-by-spotting-on-target-host-dps5nd","description":"Phage lysis of host bacteria can be visualized by plaque formation on lawns of host cells in soft agar overlayed on agar plates (Adams, 1959; Sambrook et al. 1989).

In this approach, the prefiltered water sample that is to be screened for phages against a given target bacterium, is enriched with a bacterial growth medium and amended with that target bacteria (Eisenstark 1967; Carlson 2005). This allows any lytic phages present in the sample to infect the target bacteria and propagate in the cultures, and subsequently, be isolated and purified. The two main advantages of the enrichment approach are 1) that it allows for screening for phages in a much larger volume of sample (typically 25\u201350 mL, rather than 5\u201310 \u00b5L), thus increasing the probability of isolating rare phages, and 2) that it allows the combination of different target hosts (e.g., different strains of a specific bacteria of interest) in the same incubation, again increasing the possibility of phage isolation.","public":"1","created_on":"1441050639","first_published_date":"2016-02-08 22:08:54","authors":"Mathias Middelboe, Amy M.

One way to measure the adsorption efficiency of cyanophages is to assay for free unadsorbed phages (Suttle and Chan 1993). The principle of this assay is to add a known quantity of viruses to host cells (e.g., at an MOI = 0.01 to 0.1). Over a period of 1 to 2 h, small subsamples of the virus:host solution are removed ca. every 15 min and diluted 100-fold to stop further adsorption. The host is then separated from free viruses by centrifugation, and the number of free viruses remaining in the supernatant determined by plaque or end-point dilution assays. A plot of the abundance of free viruses remaining in solution as a function of time should produce a straight line. The slope of this line is then used to calculate the adsorption rate.<br \/><br \/>This procedure can be adapted for other host\u2013virus systems. The example given is for host BBC1 and cyanophage BBC1-P1 (Suttle and Chan 1993).","public":"1","created_on":"1441316556","first_published_date":"2016-02-08 22:08:58","authors":"Mathias Middelboe, Amy M.
