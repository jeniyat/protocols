This drive toward earlier diagnosis and intervention has been accompanied by a debate about the value of arriving at a diagnosis of dementia earlier in the disease process. Several studies reported evidence that supports a possible beneficial effect of early and accurate diagnosis. As a result, changes in health care policies and priorities, such as the introduction of an opportunistic \"dementia case-finding scheme\" in the United Kingdom, or the implementation of cognitive assessments in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit in the United States have occurred.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Country-specific guidelines and\/or systematic literature reviews on which instruments to favor have already been published for the primary care setting. For the hospital setting however, where dementia and cognitive impairment are much more prevalent comparable guidelines do not exist.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Even though screening instruments advocated for the use in primary care setting are often not restricted to primary care, variations in demographic features, disease prevalence, and severity but also, differences in test conditions (e.g., timing, interventions between index test and reference standard) entail external validation prior to general application in hospital setting. In response to this demand, two systematic reviews have been conducted to establish adequate tools for dementia screening, considering the particularities of the population to be evaluated. However, while B.A. Appels et al. (2010) mostly reported validation studies sampling from selected outpatients with a focus on rather extensive screening instruments (10 to 45min administration time), Jackson et al. (2013) found a remarkable lack of robust evidence; the largest evidence base was found for the use of the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), and reported a clear need for more validation studies to inform screening for dementia in hospital inpatients best.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In the hospital setting, the knowledge that a patient has or might have dementia is essential because of the multiple immediate implications for care. Hospital medical staff may administer brief cognitive screening tests before or on the day of admission and, depending on the test results, cause additional investigations to be made to confirm whether a diagnosis is present; provide appropriate care during the hospital stay (e.g., choice of anesthesia, involvement of primary caregiver, medication management, etc.), and realize adequate discharge management, which may then lead to avoiding new medical events known to be more likely among patients with dementia and promoting earlier diagnosis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objective<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The objective of this review is to provide clinicians, who wish to implement screening for dementia or MCI, an up-to-date choice of practical and accurate instruments that have been validated well for the use in unselected, elective hospital inpatients. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null},{"id":733082,"guid":"FC676699CA024D5DAF882C2462CFC3A2","previous_id":733081,"previous_guid":"EB5F166D43C847E194581CE2B9C092EA","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"133D908C5DA442EC9A667CEB0E88A2AE","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"A9B6830C8D324E39BB16EB02C2EBDD79","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Eligibility criteria<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Language: English and German<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Study size: > 100<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Target condition: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and any common dementia subtype<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Setting: General or University hospital<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Population: Unselected samples of elective inpatients (male and female) older than 64 years; mixed cohorts only if separate data was presented for outnumbered elective inpatients; patients of wards providing services for patients with disease related to dementia were excluded<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Index test: Multi-domain, brief (<15min), cognitive performance tests, excluding informant rated, telephonic or computerized tests, excluding measures, assessing daily living activities and functional status, excluding self-administered tests<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Reference standard: Studies will be included that used a reference standard for MCI, all-cause dementia or any standardized definition of subtypes.

For dementia subtypes (e.g. AD or probable AD, vascular dementia, or Lewy body dementia) common diagnostic criteria will be included. In order not to further restrict the number of eligible studies, diagnostic accuracy studies that compared the index test with a diagnosis based on an expert consensus, or results of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test will be also included.
