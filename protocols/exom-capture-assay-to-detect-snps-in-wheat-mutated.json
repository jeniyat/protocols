Among these, rust diseases are the most detrimental in depressing wheat production. In the present study, chemical mutagen was used to induce mutations in a wheat variety NN-Gandum-1 (moderately resistant to leaf and yellow rust) for improving resistance to the disease as well as studying function of genes conferring resistance to the disease. In the present investigation, 0.8% EMS dose was found optimum for supporting 45-55% germination of NN-Gandum-1. A total of 3,634 M<sub>2<\/sub> fertile plants were produced from each of the M<sub>1<\/sub> plant. Out of these, 33 (0.91 %) and 20 plants (0.55%) showed absolute resistance to leaf and yellow rust, respectively. While 126 (3.46%) and 127 plants (3.49%) exhibited high susceptibility to the leaf and yellow rust, respectively. In M<sub>4<\/sub> generation, a total of 11 M<sub>4<\/sub> lines (nine absolute resistant and two highly susceptible) and one wild type were selected for NGS-based exome capture assay. A total of 104,779 SNPs were identified that were randomly distributed throughout the wheat sub genomes (A, B and D). Maximum number of mutations were found in introns. Highest number of SNPs were detected in chr.2B (14,273 SNPs). Mutation density was one mutation per 20.91 Mb. Highest mutation frequency was found in chr.7D (1\/2.83 Mb) and the lowest in chr.2D (1\/85.17 Mb). Out of the detected mutations, 101 SNPs were selected using priority analysis criteria. Out of these, SNPs detected in <em>Lr21<\/em> were selected for further analysis. The SNP identified in chimeric allele (<em>Lr21<\/em>) of a resistant mutant (N1-252) was located in NBS domain of chr.1BS at 3.4 Mb that possibly activated the function of chimeric allele. Through computational analysis, it was demonstrated that identified SNP substituted the glutamic acid with alanine\u2014resulted in altered protein structure. It was concluded that induced mutations are extremely helpful not only in generating novel genetic resource but can also exploited for getting insight into the important biological circuits of different traits of complex genomes like wheat.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"11613","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1524117653","protocol_affiliation":"National institute fro biotechnology and Genetic Engineering,University of vienna","affiliation":"National Institute for Biotechnology and genetic Engineering","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.pj5dkq6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"MominaHussain-y2236443w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/v6pjv3n.jpg","full_name":"Momina Hussain","created_by":"Momina Hussain","private_link":"CADD3873E82DBEFB0E5781908BFBC96F","original_img":"1","username":"momina-hussain","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":306123,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"667","group_uri":"pgmb","group_name":"PGMB","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/v6ujv3n.jpg","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Momina Hussain,Atif Iqbal,Bradley J Till,Mehboob ur Rahman","authors_list":[{"name":"Momina Hussain","affiliation":"National institute fro biotechnology and Genetic Engineering","username":"momina-hussain","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/v6pjv3n.jpg"},{"name":"Atif Iqbal","affiliation":"National institute fro biotechnology and Genetic Engineering","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Bradley J Till","affiliation":"University of vienna","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Mehboob ur Rahman","affiliation":"National institute fro biotechnology and Genetic Engineering","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/v6pjv3n.jpg","username":"momina-hussain","full_name":"Momina Hussain","created_by":"Momina Hussain"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"622853","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"7CF90B5AFC63461DABD0402554307467","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1524118851","components":[{"component_id":"1093566","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"D7F9F9F2A9A243A78E49FE9C83AC8C15","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1093565","previous_id":"1093566","original_id":"0","guid":"1C1C207C46D04244B5C730161C017129","previous_guid":"D7F9F9F2A9A243A78E49FE9C83AC8C15","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p><strong>Plant Material<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The hexaploid \u2018NN-Gandum-1\u2019 (<em>Triticum aestivum<\/em> L) is a spring wheat variety that was bred by making a cross (Chirya-3\/Opata\/\/2x parula\/3\/ Rohtas-90) at the PGMB Labs, NIBGE, Faisalabad Pakistan. \u2018NN-Gandum-1\u2019 (NN-1) has been evaluated for studying its adaptability throughout the Punjab province in Pakistan.
