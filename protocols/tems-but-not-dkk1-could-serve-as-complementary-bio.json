Despite its limitations, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) remains the most widely-used biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC. This study aimed to assess whether measurement of peripheral plasma Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) could overcome the limitations of AFP and improve the diagnostic accuracy of HCC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods <\/strong>Plasma DKK1 level and the percentage of TEMs in peripheral CD14+CD16+ monocytes from HCC patients (<em>n<\/em>=82), HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients (<em>n<\/em>=29), chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infected patients (<em>n<\/em>=28) and healthy volunteers (<em>n<\/em>=31) were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze a single biomarker, or a combination of two or three biomarkers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results <\/strong>The percentage of TEMs in peripheral CD14+CD16+ monocytes and plasma level of DKK1 in HCC group were significantly higher than those in LC, CHB and healthy control groups (all <em>P<\/em>-values &lt;0.05). The percentage of TEMs alone was also significantly higher in AFP-negative HCC group than that in LC, CHB and healthy control groups (all <em>P<\/em>-values &lt;0.05). Plasma DKK1 level alone could not distinguish between AFP-negative HCC and LC patients. ROC curves showed that the optimal diagnostic cutoff value was 550.93 ng\/L for DKK1 and 4.95% for TEMs. There was no significant difference in AUC of DKK1, TEMs and AFP in HCC diagnosis between the four groups (all <em>P<\/em>&gt;0.05). A combination of DKK1, TEMs and AFP measurements increased the AUC for HCC diagnosis as compared with either marker alone (0.833; 95%CI 0.768-0.886). The AUC for TEMs was 0.692 (95% CI 0.564-0.819) in differentiating AFP-negative HCC from LC, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 65.52 %.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions <\/strong>TEMs and DKK1 may prove to be potential complementary biomarkers for AFP in the diagnosis of HCC. TEMs rather than DKK1 could serve as a complementary biomarker for AFP in the differential diagnosis of AFP-negative HCC versus LC patients.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"4801","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Protocol for Analysis of Tie2-expressing Monocytes","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":null,"version_class":"6665","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1499048915","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.irhcd36","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x203a4v2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","full_name":"yueguo wang","created_by":"yueguo wang","private_link":"249B9D74C09E6A4E3B4959D4941E8C47","original_img":"1","username":"yueguo-wang","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":252614,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"TEMs,DKK1,HCC,AFP","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"","authors_list":[],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","username":"yueguo-wang","full_name":"yueguo wang","created_by":"yueguo wang"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"577069","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"8648472CD2BC47D083E700FF89ABE1A3","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":null,"last_modified":"1499390394","components":[{"component_id":"956060","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"BCFDD6D97DEB4F7C8DC58E24219E3AA1","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"956061","previous_id":"956060","original_id":"0","guid":"F415EB27C9DC490194CD9608AB11C474","previous_guid":"BCFDD6D97DEB4F7C8DC58E24219E3AA1","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"1.
