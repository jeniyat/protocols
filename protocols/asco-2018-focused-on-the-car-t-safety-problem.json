JCAR017 showed greater competition in the treatment of lymphomas than Kymriah and Yescarta. f Moreover, JCAR017 has a relatively low safety risk, that is, the probability of occurrence of cytokine release syndrome CRS and neurotoxicity (two common side effects) is relatively low and more than half of clinical patients do not have CRS or neurotoxicity.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For 102 evaluable patients (including multiple dose levels), the overall response rate and complete response rate of JCAR017 reached 40% and 34%, respectively.

In patients receiving cell therapy, the average progression-free survival was 11.8 months.
