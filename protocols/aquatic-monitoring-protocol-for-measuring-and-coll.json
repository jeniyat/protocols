These measurements estimate the abundance and presence of aquatic macroinvertebrate species in an area, and link them to environmental conditions (plant community, water temperature and pH, water nutrients, etc.) that may affect their distributions. Together, these data can reveal patterns in aquatic community or ecosystem processes. The stream measurements can be done independently but are usually paired with plant monitoring plots. When a plant monitoring plot is next to a creek or stream, the aquatic sampling occurs in the body of water nearest to the origin of the plant plot.
