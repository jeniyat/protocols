They affect the osseous marrow and cortex of the jaw bones, and are uniquely derived from the tissues of developing teeth. Odontogenic cysts are cavities lined by odontogenic derived epithelium. They are the most common lesions of the jaw, specially radicular cysts (RC) and odontogenic keratocysts (OKC). While, RC shows an indolent behavior and rarely recurs after surgical removal, the KOT is invasive and destructive. On the other hand, odontogenic tumors are classified according to behavior into benign and malignant in addition, according to origin into epithelial and mesenchymal. The most common benign odontogenic tumor is ameloblastoma.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"materials_text":null,"warning":null,"version_class":"16242","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1538180445","protocol_affiliation":"Professor oral pathology department faculty of dentistry cairo university,Professor oral pathology department faculty of dentistrycairo university,Assisstant lecturer oral pathology faculty of dentistry cairo university","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.t4seqwe","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t26423t2u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","full_name":"Asmaa Rashad","created_by":"Asmaa Rashad","private_link":"A119D7803ED38D93DA4A0C37DEDBA316","original_img":"1","username":"asmaa-rashad","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Aro,  K;  Rosa,  LE;  Bello,  IO;  Soini, Y;  M\u00e4kitie,  AA;  Salo, T and  Leivo,  I.: expression pattern of claudins 1 and 3-an auxiiliary tool in predicting behavior of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of salivary gland origin.
