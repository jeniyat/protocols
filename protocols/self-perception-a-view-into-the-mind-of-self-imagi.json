This is due to a mental phenomenon called self-perception, or the way a person views themself, whether it be true or false. A study was conducted by Hunter Duval, to determine the relationship between demographic information (i.e. Age, Race, Etc) and Self-Perception of individuals. The website, SurveyMonkey was used. 71 individuals from the social media platform, Reddit, and a local high school were interviewed regarding their Gender, Sexual Orientation, Race, and Perception. The study concluded that 51.62% of males, 64.86% of females, and 33.33% of other genders perceive themselves as unattractive, with females having the majority. The study also found that individuals who are part of the LGBT minority have a higher chance of perceiving themselves as unattractive than that of heterosexual, with Pansexual taking the majority. According to this data, oppressed populations and minorities seem to have a higher chance of feeling unattractive. This is likely because they are, as aforementioned, oppressed. Oppressed populations, such as those in the LGBT community, are forced to look down upon themselves by other peoples, thus causing their self-image to downgrade. Overall, minority populations are more likely to have a poorer self image than that of the majority.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1577746797}
