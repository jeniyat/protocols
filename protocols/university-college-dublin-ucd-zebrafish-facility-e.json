To this end, environmental parameters (i.e. temperature, pH and conductivity) of our zebrafish facility are constantly monitored to ensure constant\/limited variations to be introduced in the environment. We have provided information of our facility and key parameters measured for our zebrafish lines housed in University College Dublin, for 2018. These conditions are applicable to all recent peer-reviewed articles published by our lab. <\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1559742144}
