Increased levels of glucose overload mitochondria and result in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, the flow of excess glucose through cellular pathways decreases the cell\u2019s normal ability to detoxify ROS. As a result, the neurons and axons of the peripheral nervous system contain increased levels of ROS and decreased antioxidant capacity. The following assays are used to measure these changes in rodent models of diabetic neuropathy. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Diabetic Complication:<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/biw94kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1565797396}
