Besides, this need should be tackled according to the scientific evidence standards. In this sense, the new generation of evidence-based interventions suggests developing exhaustive cost-benefits analyses of the prevention programs, not just taking into account the economic and human resources, but also in terms of the impact of the programs on the beneficiaries. In the case of the interpersonal violence prevention programs, these have been focused on specific phenomena, basically bullying and cyber bullying, and just in the last years psycho-educational programs that tackle with the violent phenomena in adolescent in a comprehensive way (Espelage et al., 2015). However, in Spain, there seems not to be prevention programs of this nature assessed. To cover this lack, we propose two basic aims. The first one, is to develop an analysis of the common factors which predicts the involvement in the several types of interpersonal violence in adolescence and to test an explicative model to identify the relevance of individual social-emotional factors, as well as peers group factors and teachers factors. Secondly, the efficacy of a comprehensive psycho-educational program against the interpersonal violence in adolescence (bullying, cyber bullying, sexual violence and dating violence) will be designed, implemented and assessed, analyzing besides, the possible mediator effects of the predictor factors, as well as, its possible differential impact on the diverse addressees. To achieve the objectives of the project, two longitudinal studies will be developed. The first one, to get the first objective, will be a longitudinal study with three points of measurement, with a time lapse between three and six months between each time. The second one, related to the second objective, will be an RCT (Randomized Control Trial) study with two groups (quasi-experimental and control) and pre-test, post-test, and follow-up measures. For both studies, the CSI (Cultural and Social-Economical Index) will be used to choose the sample, so several youngsters of different vulnerability and risk levels will be included. The statistical analyses planned to get the objectives will be: confirmatory factor, longitudinal invariance and multilevel (including class, school and student) analyses. The expected results will allow to make progress in the knowledge of the complex relations between bullying, cyber bullying, dating violence and sexual violence, making it easier to develop an integrative theoretical model of the interpersonal violence among adolescents and the identification of the factors to get involved in these phenomena. To implement and assess a prevention program based on those factors, according to the scientific evidence standards, will make it possible to offer the scientific and educative community key elements about how to tackle, in an effective way, this public health problem\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"materials_text":null,"warning":null,"version_class":"16216","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1538132044","protocol_affiliation":"DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY.
