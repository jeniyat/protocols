IPTG\u00a0triggers RNAPT7 expression and accumulation in cells before collection.\u00a0Reactions take place when the cell extract is mixed with a maltodextrin-based energy solution along with amino acids solution and other salts (Magnesium and Potassium). This system allows\u00a0transcription\/translation coupled reactions from plasmid DNA that contains T7 promoter transcriptional units. In our hands, it\u00a0has been possible to express different fluorescent reporters, including deGFP which is highly efficient. Products of the reaction can be measured during the whole reaction time in a plate reader with appropriate optic filters, open hardware cameras, and\u00a0microscopes. When set up correctly, deGFP fluorescence intensity is detected as fast as \u223c30 minutes after\u00a0the reaction starts and it shows a rapid increase during the first \u223c2.5-3.0 hours.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The system presented here contains the features highlighted\u00a0bellow,\u00a0and is an adaptation of protocols and findings from the following listed papers:<br \/><br \/><strong>1.- This system uses maltodextrin\u00a0and Polyphosphate-based energy solution: These reagents do not need refrigeration while transporting.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><br \/>Kim, H.-C., Kim, T.-W., Kim, D.-M., .
