Rats were then rapidly intubated and mechanically ventilated (tidal volume, 1 ml\/100 g body weight; ventilation rate, 65 strokes\/min) by a constant volume small animal ventilator (Model 683, Harvard Apparatus). A left thoracotomy was performed at the fourth intercostal space, and the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was then ligated by irreversible tightening of a 6\u20130 suture loop. Myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by regional cyanosis of the myocardial surface distal to the suture, accompanied by S-T segment elevation on the electrocardiogram. Following successful induction of MI, the chest cavity was compressed to evacuate any air before being tightly sealed. The rats were given buprenorphine (0.05 mg\/kg) pre-operatively, then Q 8\u201312 hours post-operatively by subcutaneous injection for 48 h. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":828734,"guid":"3CF2D94CC5A94C4090A6F0B6AC944B24","previous_id":828733,"previous_guid":"536FF184F6804510B81A08F21C1E5AE8","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"47E608FE50994EFEA23B2B6A2F392E7B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"91F77F4FF9EF492EB1213EC73E14EE1B","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">In<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-style:italic;\"> <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">vivo<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> Residual LV Function Evaluation by Echocardiography <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Transthoracic echocardiographic images of hearts from all groups of rats were obtained using an ultra high-resolution ultrasound scanner (Vevo 2100; VisualSonics, Inc.) under light anesthesia.

All measurements were averaged in five consecutive cardiac cycles and analyzed off-line by a single blinded observer using software resident on the ultrasonograph. All calculations were derived using standard formulas.
