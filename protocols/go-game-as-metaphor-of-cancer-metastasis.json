In the game of Go, black stones that play first\u00a0could correspond to a metaphor of the birth, growth, and metastasis of cancer. Moreover, playing white stones on the second turn could correspond the inhibition of cancer invasion. Mathematical modeling and algorithmic simulation of Go may,\u00a0therefore, benefit the efforts to deploy therapies to surpass cancer illness by providing insight into the cellular growth and expansion over a tissue area. We use the Ising Hamiltonian, that models the energy exchange in interacting particles, for modeling the cancer dynamics. Parameters in the energy function refer the biochemical elements that induce cancer birth, growth, and metastasis; as well as the biochemical immune system process of defense.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>From http:\/\/delta.cs.cinvestav.mx\/~matias\/CancerModelingSimulation\/principal.html, take the executable GoIsingCancer.
