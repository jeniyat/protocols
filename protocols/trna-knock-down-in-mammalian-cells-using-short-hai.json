The pSUPER plasmid contains unique BglII and HindIII restriction site which can be used for integration of anealed forward and reverse shRNA oligonucleotides. This positions the shRNA oligonucleotide immediately downstream of the polymerase-III H1-RNA gene promoter, enabling expression of the desired shRNA. A T5 (5 consecutive thymidines) termination signal follows immediately downstream of the HindIII cloning site.
