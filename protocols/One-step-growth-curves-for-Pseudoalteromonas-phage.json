Compare your 3 growth curves and see when the host is in mid-exponential (log linear) phase.\u00a0 This is the right time to start an infection. <br \/><br \/>2.) \u00a0Determine the concentration of your culture at the time you want to start the infection. Use a correlation of readings from the plate reader and cell counts (CFU, DAPI, or FCM counts) to estimate this.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>3.) \u00a0Calculate the volume of host culture needed for 10<sup>8<\/sup> <br \/><br \/>4.) \u00a0Pipet this amount into three 1.5 ml tubes, labeled A, B, and C (these are your triplicate infections). <br \/><br \/>5.) \u00a0Add 10<sup>7<\/sup> phages to each tube and start your timer for 15 minutes to allow the phages to adsorb to the host cells. <br \/><br \/>6.) \u00a0After 15 minutes, dilute each infection 1:100 in Zobell media in a 250 ml flask (also labeled A, B, and C). These flasks should be in the shaker for the duration of the experiment. <br \/><br \/>7.) \u00a0Take a sample immediately after dilution \u2013 this is \u2018time 0\u2019. <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. 0.2 \u03bcm filter 1 ml from each flask into a 1.5 ml tube. Use a 25 mm or smaller syringe filter. <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 i. If your diluted infection is less than 40 ml, you will need to take smaller samples. Never use more 25% of the volume for the experiment (note that you will be taking 10 samples from each flask).\u00a0 You can use as little as 500 \u03bcl if necessary. <br \/><br \/>8.) \u00a0Continue sampling in this way every 20 minutes for 3 hours. <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. This is a total of 10 time points: T0 \u2013 T9. <br \/><br \/>9.) \u00a0Store the filtered samples at 4 \u00b0<br \/><br \/><br \/><strong>Evaluating samples from the one-step experiment<\/strong>: <br \/><br \/>1.) \u00a0Try to analyze the samples as soon after the one-step experiment as possible so they don\u2019t degrade. <br \/><br \/>2.) \u00a0Calculate the expected concentration of phages at time 0. This will depend on the total volume of the initial infection (i.e., the volume of 10<sup>8<\/sup> cells plus 10<sup>7<\/sup> phages).\u00a0 So the concentration at T0 should be 10<sup>7<\/sup>\/volume of infection, divided by 100 (for the 1:100 dilution).\u00a0 Convert this to phages per ml. <br \/><br \/>3.) \u00a0Once you know how many phages to expect (usually near 10<sup>5<\/sup>), you know what dilutions of your early samples to plate to get good counts. For example, if the T0 expected concentration is 10<sup>5<\/sup>, there should be 100 plaques if you plate 100 \u03bcl of a 10<sup>-2<\/sup> <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. Keep in mind that some of the phages will have adsorbed to cells and will not show up as plaques, so the actual concentration you calculate at T0 will be less than the expected concentration. This difference gives you the number of phages that infected a cell during the 15 minute adsorption period. <br \/><br \/>4.) \u00a0All samples should be plated and counted in triplicate to account for plating errors. <br \/><br \/>5.) \u00a0Start by plating one replicate of all 30 samples. Plating all samples on one day reduces errors due to the phages degrading over time.\u00a0 Plate several dilutions of each sample to ensure that you will be able to get a good count. <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. A general guideline is that the phage concentration will increase by 10\u2014100x during the burst, which should be at about the mid-point of the experiment. However, the burst can happen earlier or later and the exact size of it will vary, so give yourself some leeway in the dilutions you plate. <br \/><br \/>6.) \u00a0The next day, count the plaques on all plates that have a countable number of them. Decide with dilution gives the best count at each time point. <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. Depending on the size of the plaques, a good count will be somewhere between 10 and a few hundred. <br \/><br \/>7.) \u00a0Plate two more replicates of each time point. Use the dilution you decided was best. <br \/><br \/>8.) \u00a0The next day, count plaques on the new plates, and also check the first replicate to see if any new plaques have appeared. Add these to your original count. <br \/><br \/>9.) \u00a0The next day, check replicates two and three for new plaques. <br \/><br \/>10.) \u00a0When reporting results of the one-step, first average the three plating replicates for each time point. Then average the three biological replicates (A, B, and C) and calculate standard deviations for each time point.\u00a0 Graph the results. <br \/><br \/>11.) \u00a0Calculate burst size <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. Take the average of the time points on the plateau before the burst (A). <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0b. Take the average of the time points on the plateau after the burst (B). <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0c. Subtract A from B. This is the total burst (C). <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0d. Divide C be the number of infecting phage (expected phages at T0 minus actual). This is the burst size.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[]}
