A body of recent work has shown that childhood SES is positively related to EF, but it is not known whether this disparity grows, diminishes or holds steady over development, from childhood through adulthood.\u00a0 We examined the association between childhood SES and EF in a sample ranging from 9-25 years of age, with six canonical EF tasks.\u00a0 Analyzing all of the tasks together and in functionally defined groups, we found positive relations between SES and EF, and the relations did not vary by age. Analyzing the tasks separately, SES was positively associated with performance in some but not all EF measures, depending on the covariates used, again without varying by age.\u00a0 These results add to a growing body of evidence that childhood SES is associated with EF abilities, and contribute novel evidence concerning the persistence of this association into early adulthood.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"13633","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1530970882","protocol_affiliation":"The University of Pennsylvania,University of California, Los Angeles,Temple University","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ri9d4h6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"4323b4v2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_document.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/013.png","full_name":"Briana Last","created_by":"Briana Last","private_link":"12E275AB4A012B55955F0641F9CFBEA9","original_img":"1","username":"briana-last","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":329172,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Briana Last,Gwen M.
