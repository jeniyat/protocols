Draw a circle (c1).<\/p>\n<p>2. Within that circle, about a third of the way from the top draw two points.<\/p>\n<p>3. Another third of the way draw a semicircle (starting at the top and curving down, then back up).<\/p>\n<p>4. from the bottom of the circle extend a line (L1) down, roughly twice the diameter of circle C1.<\/p>\n<p>5. from the center of\u00a0line L1, draw two lines extending up, at roughly 45 degrees from each other and centered on the orginal line.<\/p>\n<p>6. from the end of line L1, draw two lines\u00a0again with\u00a0roughly 45 degrees between them, centered on the original line.<\/p>\n<p>7. next to the right bottom line, draw another circle C2 (similar size to\u00a0 circle C1).<\/p>\n<p>8. Within this circle draw 4 pentagons, one near the top, one near the bottom, one near the left, and one near the right, having them almost touch each other.<\/p>\n<p>9. Shade in these pentagons.<\/p>\n<p>10. further to the right draw a line (L2) (parallel to the L1, starting at the same height as circle C1 and ending at the same bottom point as the circle C2.<\/p>\n<p>11. from the bottom of line L2, draw a perpendicular line (L3) to the right, about 1\/2 the length of L2<\/p>\n<p>12. Connect the top of\u00a0L2 with the end of line L3 with an arc.<\/p>\n<p>13. Add some medium cross hatching to this shape. (cross hatching is perpendicular lines that fill the interior of the shape).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"14297","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1533057417","protocol_affiliation":"IQSS","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.r7zd9p6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t23423q2w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","full_name":"Gustavo Durand","created_by":"Gustavo Durand","private_link":"071D192D6D3D5683F948FE65BD2BD51D","original_img":"1","username":"gustavo-durand","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":335926,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":1,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Gustavo Durand","authors_list":[{"name":"Gustavo Durand","affiliation":"IQSS","username":"gustavo-durand","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","username":"gustavo-durand","full_name":"Gustavo Durand","created_by":"Gustavo Durand"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"0","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[]}
