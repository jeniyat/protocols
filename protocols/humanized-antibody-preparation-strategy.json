Antibody library technology<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The production of phage antibody library technology relies on the development of three experimental techniques: one is the development of PCR technology that allows one to clone a complete set of immunoglobulin variable regions from B lymphocyte total RNA by RP-TCR. Genes, making the construction of antibody libraries simple and easy to manipulate. One is the establishment of phage display technology to achieve the unification of genotype and phenotype, providing a highly efficient screening system, which is the core of phage antibody technology. The other is to secrete a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule that expresses binding ability from Escherichia coli.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>Phage antibody libraries unite phenotypes and genotypes. Combining the selection ability and the amplification ability, it has a powerful screening function, which can simulate the antibody production process in vivo in vitro, and make the antibody engineering technology enter a new era. The development of phage antibody library technology has made it possible to obtain antibodies without immunization in vitro. Because it occurs in vitro, it does not rely on the antibody recognition and presentation system in vivo, and can theoretically produce antibodies against any substance. At present, phage antibody library technology is also insufficient. For example, antibody affinity obtained from an antibody library of an immunized animal is high, limited by the conversion rate of the foreign gene, and the storage capacity of the antibody library is insufficient to cover the antibody diversity of some animals. Therefore, a large-capacity antibody library is the key to obtaining high-affinity antibodies and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativebiolabs.net\/Anti-CD19-fully-human-monoclonal-antibody-MDX-1342-32078.htm\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">fully human monoclonal antibody<\/span><\/a><span>\u00a0against rare antigens.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">B. Transgenic mouse technology<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Through gene knockout technology, the mouse's own gene is inactivated and introduced into a new gene, creating a transgenic mouse carrying the human antibody heavy light chain gene cluster and inactivation of its own gene. The human DNA fragment carried by the transgenic antibody gene mouse has a complete function and can efficiently perform isotype gene transformation and affinity maturation.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Human antibodies prepared from transgenic mice are superior to anti-normal human protein monoclonal antibodies produced by other techniques. The antibody system that recognizes antigens and mobilizes antigens in mice remains intact, and it is easy to recognize human proteins as foreign bodies. In addition, since the antibody is produced in vivo, it undergoes normal equipment and maturation processes to ensure a high target binding affinity of the finished product. However, transgenic mice also have some drawbacks, that is, transgenes usually have in vivo cell mutations and other unique sequences leading to incomplete human sequences. Moreover, since the antibodies are assembled in mice, the resulting monoclonal antibodies have a murine glycosylation pattern, so these monoclonal antibodies are ultimately not fully humanized.<\/div><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1563780480}
