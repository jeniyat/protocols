Adaptation of creatinine measurement to microtiter wells enables convenient, simultaneous determination of albumin and creatinine concentrations in the same specimen, using analogous microtiter plate formats. Normalization of albumin excretion in relation to creatinine facilitates classification according to defined ranges of microalbuminuria, the established marker of the early diabetic renal dysfunction.
