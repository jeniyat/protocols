In order to stabilize the current, the adaptation rules based on state-observer and Lyapunov function are being designed. A fractional order sliding surface function is defined based on the tracking current error and adaptative rules. Furthermore, through fractional order analysis, the stability of the fractional order control system is proven, and the value of the fractional order (\u03bb) is being investigated. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AFSMC strategy is being verified by numerical simulations. The advantages of good transient response and robustness to uncertainy are being indicated by this design, when compared with a conventional integer order sliding mode control system.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"10900","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1521288457","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":"Department of mechanical electrical engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.nvude6w","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Wang-y2t24413p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","full_name":"Wang jianlin","created_by":"Wang jianlin","private_link":"8D746F6637E356A3C375278CA8FE5B51","original_img":"1","username":"wang-jianlin","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":263014,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"647","group_uri":"ev","group_name":"EV","group_logo":"","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"wangjianl","authors_list":[{"name":"wangjianl","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","username":"wang-jianlin","full_name":"Wang jianlin","created_by":"Wang jianlin"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"615218","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"256461B9980748699A11322E4F19C01C","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1521292044","components":[{"component_id":"1073734","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"2A8D2D3D11D741888049B3787E1F6DE2","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"fig","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"fig"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1073735","previous_id":"1073734","original_id":"0","guid":"FE82970D6D174B1A8A84782A0A981996","previous_guid":"2A8D2D3D11D741888049B3787E1F6DE2","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"615219","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"7B45C13607774B83A8077AED23F029C8","previous_guid":"256461B9980748699A11322E4F19C01C","previous_id":"615218","last_modified":"1521292044","components":[{"component_id":"1073736","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"EC36ED8C4BE14705962289F7A0941895","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"manuscript","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"manuscript"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1073737","previous_id":"1073736","original_id":"0","guid":"4700BDD3231B47979394193E4AA3EEAA","previous_guid":"EC36ED8C4BE14705962289F7A0941895","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]}]}
