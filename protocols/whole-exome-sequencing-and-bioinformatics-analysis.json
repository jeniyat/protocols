Exome capturing and enrichment was carried out using SureSelect All Exon\u00a0V5\u00a0kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the manufacturers' protocols. Whole exome sequencing was carried out on Illumina HiSeq\u00a02500\u00a0system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Paired end (2\u00d7100 bases) DNA sequence reads that passed the quality control i.e phred score &gt; 20 were mapped to the human reference genome build hg19\/GRCh37 using the BWA (Li, Durbin 2010) and SAM tools (Li, Handsaker et al. 2009) was used for processing BAM files.\u00a0 Genome analysis tool kit (GATK) v2.7.2 ) (McKenna, Hanna et al. 2010) was used for calling variants from BAM files. Variants were annotated with gene, existing variations, consequences from dbSNP (build 137), SIFT v5.0.2 (Kumar, Henikoff et al. 2009) and polyphen v2.2.2 (Adzhubei, Schmidt et al. 2010) using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor v73 (VEP) (McLaren, Pritchard et al. 2010).\u00a0 Known variants were annotated by dbSNP and unannotated variants with serious predicted consequences were identified based on SIFT and polyphen which were considered as novel variants. Variants were filtered for increased accuracy using following steps: a) variants were filtered at the read depth (DP) &gt;= 10 b) Variants with &gt;10% i.e &gt; 0.1 minor allele frequency based on 1000 Genome project ((<a href=\"http:\/\/www.1000genomes.org\/data\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.1000genomes.org\/data<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>References:<\/p>\n<p>ADZHUBEI, I.A., SCHMIDT, S., PESHKIN, L., RAMENSKY, V.E., GERASIMOVA, A., BORK, P., KONDRASHOV, A.S. and SUNYAEV, S.R., 2010.
