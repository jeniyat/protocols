\"text-block\">Like the qualitative assay, this is a dot blot performed with streptavidin and aptamers, also named paper ELONA.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The expected result is a good binding between the streptavidin and the aptamers (knowing already that the streptavidin binds correctly to the nitrocellulose membrane thanks to previous experiments), great hybridization between both aptamers and a clear visible result when yielding with the ABTS. In order to make this experiment quantitative, several concentrations are made from the same mix, to test the minimum concentration with a detectable change of color.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1571575059}
