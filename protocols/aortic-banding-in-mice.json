A topical depilatory agent is applied to the neck and chest and the area is cleaned with betadine and alcohol. Mice are placed supine and temperature maintained at 37\u00baC with a heating pad. A horizontal skin incision ~ 0.5 - 1.0 cm in length is made at the level of the suprasternal notch. The thyroid is retracted and a 2 - 3-mm longitudinal cut is made in the proximal portion of the sternum. This allows for visualization of the aortic arch under low power magnification. A wire with a snare on the end is passed under the aorta between the origin of the right innominate and the left common carotid arteries. A 6-0 silk suture is snared with the wire and pulled back around the aorta. A bent 27-gauge needle is then placed next to the aortic arch and the suture is snugly tied around the needle and the aorta. Following ligation, the needle is quickly removed. The skin is closed and mice are allowed to recover on a warming pad until they were fully awake. The sham procedure is identical except that the aorta is not ligated.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Summary: <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol describes the procedure used by the DiaComp for inducing pressure overload hypertrophy in mice.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Diabetic Complication:<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bh3b4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1569605804}
