This is why pot experiments need to be replicated at least four times, to produce a minimum of four plants per treatment for cyanide determination in cassava leaves. Four plants of the same variety are recommended due to the high variability of leaf HCN levels between plants of the same variety and also between leaves of the same cassava plant growing on a field.

The first-fully expanded leaf should not have any of its lobes still in a folded state. The leaf may still appear as a rather small leaf yet much like the other older leaves in appearance. Slowly examine the plant to identify which leaf it is. The next two leaves after the first-fully expanded leaf are much easier to identify. Leaves must be picked together with their petioles to avoid damage to the leaf blade, which could prematurely release cyanide. It is the leaf blade that is of interest during cyanide determination in cassava leaves. The three picked leaves from each plant should be placed in labelled plastic bags. Note that if leaves are collected from a field or experimental plot then 12 leaves would have been collected and placed in plastic bag together. However if the experiment is a pot experiment then only 3 leaves would have been collected and placed in a plastic bag, as each plant in a pot is a treatment on its own. The leaves in the plastic bags must be immediately placed and temporarily stored in a cool box until all plants in the experiment have been sampled. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Note:<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">In an experiment, sampling must be carried out on the same day if you can manage to prepare and have all leaves incubated (if using picrate paper method for cyanide determination in fresh cassava leaves), ideally within the first 8 - 10 hours after they have been all picked. If this cannot be done, sample each experimental block or two blocks of the experiment consecutively over the next 2 - 3 days and not more. This is because differences in plant age can introduce changes in a plants leaf cyanogenic glucoside content.
