While hemodialysis (HD) is the current life-saving standard of treatment for patients with ESRD, their quality of life (QoL) remains far from desirable. Online HDF (OL-HDF), due to its convenience, could improve the QoL of patients with ESRD, however, this remains uncertain.<\/p>\n<p>We will aim to assess the body of evidence of OL-HDF compared to HD regarding QoL in patients with ESRD.<\/p>\n<p>We will comprehensively search in\u00a0MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases\u00a0from their inception to February 2018. Reviewers working independently and in duplicate appraised the quality and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated, in patients with ESRD and HD or OL-HDF, QoL (Short Form Health Survey with 36 questions (SF-36) with physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) as well as scores about social activity, fatigue, and emotion). A meta-analysis of each outcome of interest will be performed using a random-effects model.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"materials_text":null,"warning":null,"version_class":"13582","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1530691948","protocol_affiliation":"Mayo Clinic, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension,","affiliation":"Toranomon Hospital","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.rhnd35e","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"TatsuyaSuwabe-43239413w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/012.png","full_name":"Tatsuya Suwabe","created_by":"Tatsuya Suwabe","private_link":"2779D2EA514C792B491334BB16A7027F","original_img":"1","username":"tatsuya-suwabe","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0205037","manuscript_citation":"Suwabe T,  Barrera-Flores FJ,  Rodriguez-Gutierrez R,  Ubara Y,  Takaichi K (2018) Effect of online hemodiafiltration compared with hemodialysis on quality of life in patients with ESRD: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.
