cells, designed to limit excessive reactions and prevent autoimmunity. Tregs are characterized by the expression of CD4, CD25, and FOXP3, while lacking CD127. CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells have been referred to as \"naturally-occurring\" regulatory T cells to distinguish them from \"suppressor\" T cell populations that are generated in vitro. While other variants of suppressive T cells do exist, such as CD8 suppressor cells, Th3 and Tr-1 cells, Tregs are classically defined as CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells. Here, we provide a protocol for immunofluorescent staining of FOXP3 in frozen sections, adapted from a protocol from Dr. Matthias Hardtke-Wolenski, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. This protocol has been successfully used on mouse spleen, liver, and skin sections.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1575584839}
