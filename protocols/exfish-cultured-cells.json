Here, we present a strategy for expansion microscopy of RNA. We developed a small-molecule linker that enables RNA to be covalently attached to a swellable polyelectrolyte gel synthesized throughout a biological specimen. Then, postexpansion, fluorescent\u00a0<em>in situ<\/em>\u00a0hybridization (FISH) imaging of RNA can be performed with high yield and specificity as well as single-molecule precision in both cultured cells and intact brain tissue. Expansion FISH (ExFISH) separates RNAs and supports amplification of single-molecule signals (i.e., via hybridization chain reaction) as well as multiplexed RNA FISH readout. ExFISH thus enables super-resolution imaging of RNA structure and location with diffraction-limited microscopes in thick specimens, such as intact brain tissue and other tissues of importance to biology and medicine.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>*Sodium Acrylate, purity note: check for yellow color upon resuspension: that indicates poor quality; solution should be clear (see <a href=\"http:\/\/expansionmicroscopy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/expansionmicroscopy.org<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stock solutions:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\n<p><em>MOPS Buffer<\/em>: 20 mM MOPS pH 7.7<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For conveniently adjusting the final volume, prepare the MOPS buffer at 10 times the final concentration (i.e. 200mM MOPS pH 7.7).

After removal of the chamber, a 1 mm silicone spacer remains with the coverslip and can be used to cast the gel. If cells are grown on coverglass, then a chamber similar to the slice gelation chamber can be made using coverslip spacers. If cells are grown in Nunc Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass, we have found that the bottom coverglass along with its 1 mm gasket can be removed from the rest of the plate.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/vdvfw26.png\" width=\"355\" height=\"98\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/vdufw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-30 at 6.28.30 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_private":"0","public_protocol":"1","can_edit":0,"can_delete":"0","show_name":"0","created_date":"1522178710","created_on":"1522178710","modified_on":"1523282147","last_updated":"1523282147","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","full_name":"Ed Boyden","affiliation":null,"username":"ed-boyden","email":"esb@media.mit.edu","pa_useranme":"ed-boyden","comments":[]},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1079276","previous_id":"1079273","original_id":"0","guid":"1965A566E08D45058F1D77A4EBED577F","previous_guid":"9043CBE9DE054A74A77BDD715C26F347","component_type_id":"26","data_id":"18057","data":"","order_id":"3","name":"Note","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"26","source_data":{"annotation_id":"18057","thread_id":"18057","id":"18057","thread_title":"Comment on step 15 of ExFISH - Cultured Cell Methods","uri":"comment-on-step-15-of-exfish-cultured-cell-methods1","thread_uri":"comment-on-step-15-of-exfish-cultured-cell-methods1","step_id":"617159","protocol_uri":"exfish-cultured-cells-n32dgqe","protocol_name":"ExFISH - Cultured Cells","protocol_name_html":"ExFISH - Cultured Cells","annotation":"<ul>\n<li>For <strong>Grace\u00a0Bio labs\u00a0removable coverglass,<\/strong> use the removal tool to remove the top wells leaving behind the black silicone gasket.
