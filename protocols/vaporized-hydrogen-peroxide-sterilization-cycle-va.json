Low temperature sterilization using vaporized hydrogen peroxide do not have a specific standard published yet and to validate the sterization cycles from this type of equipment, ISO 14937, the base standard for all sterilization cycle validation, should be followed. This standard uses biological indicator (BI) as an instrument for equipament performance evaluation and its cycle configuration must be according to half cycle approach. Since most of the manufactures do not have this option avaiable for the performance evaluation, cycles will canceled when the half cycle has been\u00a0reached and the plasma phase concluded, when applicable. Since the US FDA is the only independent organism that has some type of product registration, equipments and self contained BIs that have been approved by them will be used in this study only.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>Equipment must have been calibrated and passed thru preventive maintenance in the past month.
