For enrichment of mitochondrial genome, a previous study developed an original targeted capture method that use baits constructed from long-range polymerase chain reaction(PCR) amplicons, common laboratory reagents, and equipment. In this protocol, a new targeted capture method is presented, that of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) double capture (BDC), modifying the previous method, but using BAC libraries as baits for sequencing a relatively large gene.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"2857","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"MinElute PCR Purification Kit","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"28004","reagent_url":null,"reagent_vendor_id":"25","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.qiagen.com\/us\/products\/","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Qiagen","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126226","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"NucleoBond BAC100","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"133","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.mn-net.com\/","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Macherey and Nagel","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126227","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"human Cot-1 DNA","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126228","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"PCR grade water","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"126229","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Dynabeads M-270 Streptavidin","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"191","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.thermofisher.com\/us\/en\/home\/brands\/invitrogen.html","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Invitrogen -
