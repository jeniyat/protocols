PBMC contain various T and NK cell populations, which produce cytokines upon specific stimulation with antigens. T (and NK) cells can be stimulated in various ways: using whole virus, bacteria (or membrane fractions of bacterial lysates), antigenic peptides etc. The stimulation guide provided with this protocol refers to stimulation with antigenic peptides, influenza virus and a standard cell mitogen (Concanavalin A, ConA), though it can be adapted to incorporate any other cell stimulant.<\/p>\n<p>This method is used to stimulate influenza specific cytokine production. After PBMC stimulation, cells are stained to detect cytokine producing T (and\/or NK) cells by flow cytometry. Antigens are presented by antigen presenting cells (APC), which are also present among PBMC. In this procedure the Golgi apparatus is blocked by Brefeldin A and Monensin in order to keep all the cytokines produced after stimulation within the cell. The number of influenza specific cytokine producing T (and\/or NK) cells can be determined by staining cells with fluorophore conjugated antibodies specific for the cytokine(s) of interest and counted on a flow cytometer.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7759","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1505114508","protocol_affiliation":"Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jtpcnmn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2t25443s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","full_name":"Miloje Savic","created_by":"Miloje Savic","private_link":"08D00720D6523A9E3255549B4224370C","original_img":"1","username":"miloje-savic","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":263604,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Flow cytometry","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"2","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Miloje Savic,Jennifer L.
