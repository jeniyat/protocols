If one uses high salt preparations, the salts can crystallize on the grid, occluding the particles and heating up the specimen. One way to overcome the problem is to first fix the sample using gluteraldehyde. Another problem is poor adsorption to plastic-coated grids (e.g., formvar). Pretreatment of the grids with poly-L-lysine can alleviate this issue. <br \/><br \/>The method for examining haloviruses was adapted from that described by Tarasov et al.
