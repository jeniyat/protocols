We assessed whether early hyperoxia negatively affects outcomes in hospitalized patients with myocardial injury.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This was a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary referral teaching hospital. Between January 2010 and December 2016, 2,376 consecutive emergency department patients with myocardial injury, defined as a peak troponin-I level \u2265 0.2 ng\/mL, within the first 24 hours of presentation were included. The metrics used to define hyperoxia were the maximum average partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2MAX<\/sub>), average partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2AVG<\/sub>), and area under the curve during the first 24 hours (AUC<sub>24<\/sub>). The association between early hyperoxia within 24 hours after presentation and clinical outcomes was evaluated using multiple imputation and logistic regression analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were new-onset cardiovascular, coagulation, hepatic, renal, and respiratory dysfunctions (sequential organ failure sub-score \u2265 2).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Compared with normoxic patients, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for PaO<sub>2MAX<\/sub>, PaO<sub>2AVG<\/sub>, and AUC<sub>24<\/sub> were 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05\u20132.27; p = 0.026), 2.13 (95% CI 1.45\u20133.12; p = 0.001), and 1.73 (95% CI 1.15\u20132.61; p = 0.008), respectively, in patients with mild hyperoxia and 6.01 (95% CI 3.98\u20139.07; p &lt; 0.001), 8.92 (95% CI 3.33\u201323.88; p &lt; 0.001), and 7.32 (95% CI 2.72\u201319.70; p = 0.001), respectively, in patients with severe hyperoxia.

An available PaO2 result within the first 24 hours after ED arrival was used as the treatment variable, and the 28-day in-hospital mortality rate was used as the dependent variable. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, demographic (age and sex), physiological (NEWS), biochemical (highest levels of TnI within 24 hours, white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, serum glucose, creatinine, albumin, bilirubin, and CRP), and electrocardiographic (STEMI or not) data, and whether patients underwent CAG, were used as independent variables, and execution of a blood gas test (whether the patient had PaO2 results) was used as the dependent variable. We selected significant variables that affected the propensity of execution of a blood gas test, and the average treatment effect was calculated using propensity score matching.We calculated the hyperoxia metrics used in a previous study [19], including the maximum PaO2 (PaO2MAX), average PaO2 (PaO2AVG), and area under the curve within the first 24 hours of admission (AUC24). To estimate the cumulative exposure to hyperoxia in each patient, we used the PaO2AVG at the start (0 hour) and endpoint (24 hour) of the curve to calculate AUC24 using the trapezoid integration method. Since hyperoxia has not been defined formally, we used cutoffs based on those determined by previous studies [14,20] (normoxia, 60\u2013120 mmHg; mild hyperoxia, 120\u2013180 mmHg; and severe hyperoxia, > 180 mmHg) and\u00a0 distribution-based cutoffs in our population using the 9th and 10th deciles (cutoff at the 80th and 90th percentiles, respectively) of the PaO2MAX, PaO2AVG, and AUC24.The variables with the most missing values in our dataset were the initial PaO2 (11.4%), initial CRP (3.1%), AUC24 (2.4%), and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) (1.1%). We performed multiple imputations using chained equations (imputation number = 20) to impute missing values [21]. Predictive mean matching values from the five nearest neighbors were chosen for imputation. We assumed that the majority of the data were missing at random, because the missing laboratory results were due to the physicians\u2019 decision to order tests depending on the patient\u2019s condition. The AUC24 could be calculated only when all time-related information included in the PaO2 report was available. Missing time variables were caused by mechanical failure during a certain study period. As we hypothesized that the mechanism underlying these missing values was completely random, theAUC24 was not used for imputation and was inserted as a passive variable.We conducted a logistic regression analysis using the imputed data, including all demographic, physiologic, laboratory, and clinical variables, and a multivariate analysis was performed using the\u00a0 variables that yielded a p-value < 0.001 in the univariate analysis. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for PaO2MAX, PaO2AVG, and AUC24 of the mild hyperoxia and severe hyperoxia groups compared with the normoxia group were calculated. The same analysis was performed on each secondary outcome (cardiovascular, coagulation, hepatic, renal, and respiratory dysfunctions). The Kaplan\u2013Meier method and log rank test were used to compare the survival probabilities of the normoxia, mild hyperoxia, and severe hyperoxia groups. The \u03c72 test was used to determine differences in categorical data and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for differences in continuous data, as all continuous variables showed a skewed distribution. All p-values were two-sided, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

The AUC24 could be calculated only when all time-related information included in the PaO2 report was available. Missing time variables were caused by mechanical failure during a certain study period. As we hypothesized that the mechanism underlying these missing values was completely random, theAUC24 was not used for imputation and was inserted as a passive variable.We conducted a logistic regression analysis using the imputed data, including all demographic, physiologic, laboratory, and clinical variables, and a multivariate analysis was performed using the\u00a0 variables that yielded a p-value < 0.001 in the univariate analysis. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for PaO2MAX, PaO2AVG, and AUC24 of the mild hyperoxia and severe hyperoxia groups compared with the normoxia group were calculated. The same analysis was performed on each secondary outcome (cardiovascular, coagulation, hepatic, renal, and respiratory dysfunctions). The Kaplan\u2013Meier method and log rank test were used to compare the survival probabilities of the normoxia, mild hyperoxia, and severe hyperoxia groups. The \u03c72 test was used to determine differences in categorical data and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for differences in continuous data, as all continuous variables showed a skewed distribution. All p-values were two-sided, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 13 (StataCorp, LP,\u00a0College Station, TX, USA)."},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1138904","previous_id":"1138903","original_id":"0","guid":"882D505ECEEB4F24B0D48EF271FCD229","previous_guid":"3D9F1089DBEF4F6DAFE5E0F00C18F5A8","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]}]}
