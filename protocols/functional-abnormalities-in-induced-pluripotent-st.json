Despite extensive research, the pathological mechanisms of DCM are unclear mainly due to numerous mutations in different gene families resulting in the same outcome - decreased ventricular function. Titin (TTN) - a giant protein, expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, is an important part a fundamental part of the sarcomere, and thus TTN mutations are the most common cause of adult DCM. To decipher the basis for the cardiac pathology in titin-mutated patients, we investigated the hypothesis that induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) generated from patients, recapitulate the disease phenotype. The hypothesis was tested by 3 Aims: (1) Investigate key features of the excitation-contraction-coupling machinery; (2) Investigate the responsiveness to positive inotropic interventions; (3) Investigate the proteome profile of the AuP cardiomyocytes using mass-spectrometry (MS). Methods and Results: iPSC were generated from the patients' skin fibroblasts. The major findings were: (1) Sarcomeric organization analysis in mutated iPSC-CM showed defects in assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric structure. (2) Mutated iPSC-CM exhibited diminished inotropic and lusitropic responses to \uf062-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, increased [Ca2+]out and angiotensin-II. Additionally, mutated iPSC-CM displayed prolonged recovery in response to caffeine. These findings may result from defective or lack of interactions of the sarcomeric components with titin through its kinase domain which is absent in the mutated cells. Conclusions: These findings show that the mutated cardiomyocytes from DCM patients recapitulate abnormalities of the inherited cardiomyopathies, expressed as blunted inotropic response.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"materials_text":null,"warning":null,"version_class":"16010","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1537629571","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology, The Rappaport Institute, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.tvien4e","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t264z2x2t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/008.png","full_name":"Revital Schick","created_by":"Revital Schick","private_link":"E0CC7A567EFB8018AEBCAF674266A89F","original_img":"1","username":"revital-schick","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0205719","manuscript_citation":"Schick R,  Mekies LN,  Shemer Y,  Eisen B,  Hallas T,  Jehuda RB,  Ben-Ari M,  Szantai A,  Willi L,  Shulman R,  Gramlich M,  Pane LS,  My I,  Freimark D,  Murgia M,  Santamaria G,  Gherghiceanu M,  Arad M,  Moretti A,  Binah O (2018) Functional abnormalities in induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived cardiomyocytes generated from titin-mutated patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
