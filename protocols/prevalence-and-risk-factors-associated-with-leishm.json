The disease burden is significantly underestimated, especially the prevalence of <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection among HIV-positive patients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods <\/strong>A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection among patients with HIV\/AIDS living in Trang Province, southern Thailand between 2015 and 2016. Antibodies against <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection were assayed using the direct agglutination test (DAT). DNA of <em>Leishmania<\/em> was detected by ITS1-PCR using the buffy coat. Species of <em>Leishmania<\/em> were also identified.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results <\/strong>Of 724 participants, the prevalence of <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection was 25.1% (182\/724) using either DAT and\/or PCR assays. Seroprevalence of<em> Leishmania <\/em>infection was 18.5% (134\/724), while <em>Leishmania <\/em>DNA detected by PCR method was 8.4% (61\/724). Of these, 24.9% (180\/724) were asymptomatic, whereas 0.3% (2\/724) were symptomatic VL and VL\/CL. At least five species were identified, that is, <em>L. siamensis<\/em>, <em>L. martiniquensis<\/em>, <em>L. donovani<\/em> complex, <em>L. lainsoni,<\/em> and <em>L. major<\/em>. Multivariate analysis showed that CD4+ levels &lt;500 cells\/\u00b5L, and living in stilt houses were independently associated with <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection. Those who were PCR positive for <em>Leishmania<\/em> DNA were significantly associated with detectable viral load. Whereas, non-injection drug use (NIDU) and CD4+ levels &lt;500 cells\/\u00b5L were potential risk factors of <em>Leishmania <\/em>seropositivity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions <\/strong>A magnitude of prevalence of underreporting <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection among Thai patients with HIV was revealed in this study.

The reliability was tested by 1,000 bootstrap replications and the Tajima-Neiwas selected for the DNA substitution model of phylogenetic analysis.<\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"588240","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"4D291B06EFC44D5D9D9E83192FE78F94","previous_guid":"8C5EC1B96BAE41EBA52499EC2FDF2090","previous_id":"588239","last_modified":"1506437810","components":[{"component_id":"1006468","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"2E76F4FDA9824E479160E9690BE69EA4","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Questionnaires","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Questionnaires"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1006467","previous_id":"1006468","original_id":"0","guid":"0B4EFD37F2DD4B0FBE353C1AE520B244","previous_guid":"2E76F4FDA9824E479160E9690BE69EA4","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>To determine the risk factors and outcome of <em>Leishmania<\/em> infection, standardized questionnaires were used.
