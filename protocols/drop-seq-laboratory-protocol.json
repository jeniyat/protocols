The size of droplets used. For the <em>Cell<\/em> paper, we used a microfluidic device that generates droplets that are 125-microns in diameter (almost exactly 1 <\/span>nL<span style=\"text-align: justify;\">). However, since the paper\u2019s publication, we have learned from our own experience, and from that of colleagues, that home-made microfluidic devices can have significant variations in droplet diameter, based on several factors related to microfluidic device master fabrication. <\/span><em style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>We therefore recommend that you perform a test of droplet volume for devices fabricated with a particular master (the procedure for measuring droplet volume can be found at the end of this protocol)<\/strong><\/em><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">. Please also note that if your droplet size differs significantly from 125-microns, you may need to adjust your flow rates from the numbers recommended in this protocol. We have used devices that produce as small as <\/span>90 micron<span style=\"text-align: justify;\"> droplets without observing any major change in Drop-seq data quality. We anticipate that droplet sizes in the range of 90-140 microns in diameter should produce perfectly fine data.<\/span><br \/>\n<div title=\"Page 7\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We recommend starting with a cell concentration of 100 cells\/ul (final concentration in droplets will be 50 cells \/ ul when mixed 1:1 with lysis buffer and beads). At this concentration, ~5% of beads collected will have been exposed to a cell (a.k.a. STAMPs). If beads are flowed in at a concentration of 120 beads\/ul, this yields 30,000 STAMPs (4 mL\/hr * 120000 beads\/mL * 0.05 = 24,000). Only 20-40% of beads are recovered after all washing and enzymatic steps, meaning that, practically speaking, ~10,000 STAMPs can be generated in 1-2 hours of droplet generation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 19\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Troubleshooting:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Low-quality droplets<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From time to time, we experience runs where droplet size is not uniform.

Device imperfections.<\/strong><span style=\"text-align: justify;\"> We generally use around 4,000 ul\/hr as our flow rate for the cell and bead channels. However, we have seen batch-to-batch variation in droplet quality produced from individual devices. If you notice droplet quality problems, reduce the flow rate of cells and beads to 3,500 ul\/hr, and decrease the oil flow rate proportionally. If this still does not produce good-quality droplets, consider switching to a new device.<\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\" title=\"Page 19\"><br \/><strong style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Devices are old (&gt;3 months).<\/strong><span style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Over time, our experience is that the Aquapel coating somehow degrades, which causes droplet quality to also decline. You may need fresh devices, or to re-treat your old devices with Aquapel.<\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\" title=\"Page 19\"><br \/><strong style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Air bubbles in the microfluidic device.<\/strong><span style=\"text-align: justify;\"> If you observed air bubbles accumulating in the microfluidic channels during droplet generation, this likely explains poor emulsion quality.

The smaller your library, the less sample you want to add to your final dilution.<\/p>","is_private":"0","public_protocol":"1","can_edit":0,"can_delete":"0","show_name":"1","created_date":"1516289275","created_on":"1516289275","modified_on":null,"last_updated":null,"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png","full_name":"Laura Fontana","affiliation":null,"username":"laura-fontana2","email":"mbrown@chanzuckerberg.com","pa_useranme":"max-brown","comments":[]},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"602760","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"EF08B55252734A468EE4F21B83A90D7D","previous_guid":"8A2FFD3BC8E7418EB7A3C6B9AC20DB24","previous_id":"602759","last_modified":"1515843083","components":[{"component_id":"1042195","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"757D90F6F103418AA8B78EA8F97CB739","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Sequencing your sample","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Sequencing your sample"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1042194","previous_id":"1042195","original_id":"0","guid":"4AC72772C5F74D09B36E2EEEA4DD8968","previous_guid":"757D90F6F103418AA8B78EA8F97CB739","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<div title=\"Page 18\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Sequencing specifications for the MiSeq or NextSeq:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Read 1: 20 bp<br \/> Read 2: 50 bp<br \/> Read 1 Index: 8 bp <strong>\u2190\u200b only necessary if you are multiplexing samples <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Custom Read 1 primer<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<div title=\"Page 18\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Sequencing specifications for the MiSeq or NextSeq:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Read 1: 20 bp<br \/> Read 2: 50 bp<br \/> Read 1 Index: 8 bp <strong>\u2190\u200b only necessary if you are multiplexing samples <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Custom Read 1 primer<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"602761","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"AABDF6E41B634E25ADD8B5A3F7EEE57B","previous_guid":"EF08B55252734A468EE4F21B83A90D7D","previous_id":"602760","last_modified":"1515843115","components":[{"component_id":"1042198","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"097C53CC2EA9473F8705B585BF406AE8","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Next steps","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Next steps"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1042197","previous_id":"1042198","original_id":"0","guid":"AAF0C064411F4012A4ED37B2ACC171E9","previous_guid":"097C53CC2EA9473F8705B585BF406AE8","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<div title=\"Page 20\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you\u2019ve gotten through to the sequencing step, you\u2019ll want to generate digital expression data, as well as basic metrics about the sequencing run.
