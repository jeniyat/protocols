For this we can pipe the output of 'seqtk comp' into the 'sort' command:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>seqtk comp y_pestis_genes.fna | sort -k 2,2 -rn | head<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ygmjtte.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/ygkjtte.png\" data-ofn=\"Screenshot (20).png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just to unpack the syntax of 'sort' a bit, the '-r' flag indicates we wish to perform a reverse sort (descending order), th e '-n' flag indicates we wish to perform a numeric sort (as opposed to alphabetical, which wouldn't make sense here), and the '-k' flag indicates the columns to use for sorting, which in this case is only the 2nd column. The default column delimiter for 'sort' is a tab, which is already the column delimiter used by 'seqtk comp' in its output, so we don't need to change anything there. If columns were separated with something else, we would want to use the '-d' flag (as with all Unix commands, check all of the features of sort by typing 'man sort').\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So in the output above we have found that\u00a0lcl|NC_003143.1_cds_YP_002346049.1_921 is the longest gene, with a length of 11,118, or a little more than 11 kilobases.
