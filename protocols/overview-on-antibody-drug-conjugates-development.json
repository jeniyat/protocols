Since the beginning of the new century, more and more people believe that antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is the answer that has long been sought.<\/p>\n<p>The ADC is made by attaching a cytotoxic small molecule drug to a monoclonal antibody via a chemical link, which combines the targeting of antibodies with the lethality of small molecule chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>During the whole process, the antibody is equivalent to the missile's \"navigation system\", which guides it to find the tumor cells. The small molecule cytotoxic drugs coupled with the antibody are equivalent to the missile's \"warhead\" and kill the tumor cells. Antibody drug conjugates use the targeting of monoclonal antibodies to target small molecule drugs to pathogens such as tumors, avoiding normal cells, thereby minimizing the damage of drugs to normal cells.<\/p>\n<p>The development of antibody drug conjugates is much more complicated than common drugs. Key processes include: target screening, selection of small molecule chemical drug warheads, design and optimization of coupled molecules, and antibody selection.<\/p>\n<p>ADC drugs are mainly used for anti-tumor, so the ideal target antigen should be expressed at a high level on the surface of tumor cells, with little or no expression in normal cell tissues. Some of the tumor targets currently screened in clinical trials are expressed only in certain types of tumor cells, and many targets are expressed in most types of tumor cells.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, after binding the antibody to the selected antigen, it can be effectively internalized, facilitating the entry of the ADC into the cell and killing the target cell.
