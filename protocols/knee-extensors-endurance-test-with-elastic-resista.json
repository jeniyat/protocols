An alternative that has increased popularity is the use of elastic tubes, which stand out for being easy to handle, low cost, practicality, and feasibility of use. To analyze the test-retest reliability of the muscle fatigue resistance test (FRT) with elastic tubes. A total of 116 healthy young males, age between 18 and 30 years old, participated in the study. Participants performed three pre-test stages: orientation, load presentation, and familiarization with equipment lasting two weeks. Subsequently, they performed the FRT on two occasions (test and retest), with an interval of seven days. The reliability analyzes were performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence interval and typical measurement error (TME), also expressed as coefficient of variation (CV%). The findings regarding the reliability of the test showed satisfactory values (time: ICC= 0.66; 95%CI [0.50; 0.76]; CV(%)= 9.34; repetition: ICC= 0.61; 95%CI [0.46; 0.73], CV(%)= 13.66; rhythm: ICC= 0.52; 95%CI [0.35; 0.67], CV(%)= 10.29). From the findings presented, it is concluded that the clinical test proposed with elastic tubes demonstrates evidence of acceptable values.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8300","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1508325002","protocol_affiliation":"S\u00e3o Paulo State University, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, Department of Physical Therapy, Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kckcsuw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2u2a4z2q2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/phrhz9n.jpg","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/013.png","full_name":"Jaqueline Silva","created_by":"Jaqueline Silva","private_link":"C19633CAB10CEACCC87FCFA5C4780121","original_img":"1","username":"jaqueline-silva","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0203259","manuscript_citation":"Lopes JSS,  Micheletti JK,  Machado AF,  Souto LR,  Lima HPd,  Vanderlei FM,  Junior JN,  Pastre CM (2018) Test-retest reliability of knee extensors endurance test with elastic resistance.
