Metformin is a widely prescribed agent to treat Type II diabetes and as illustrated in Figure 2, when Metformin (0.8-1.3 g\/kg\/D) is included in the water, it is able to establish and maintain euglycemia in the RCS10 mice over a 4- week period. However, as illustrated in in Figure 3, restoration of euglycemia with metformin did not improve ischemic outcome.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Diabetic Complications:<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkjw.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkj6.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkke.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkkn.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkkw.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkk6.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bakkme.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1565190937}
