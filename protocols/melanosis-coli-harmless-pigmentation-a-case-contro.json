The association of incidence, number, location, and<\/p>\n<p>pathology of colorectal neoplasm with grades and distribution of melanosis coli were<\/p>\n<p>analyzed.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Results: Melanosis coli was associated with significantly more colorectal polyps than<\/p>\n<p>control, a higher incidence of numerous colorectal polyps (number \u2265 20) (7.3% vs<\/p>\n<p>0.5%; p &lt; 0.001), and higher number of small colorectal polyps (diameter \u2264 5 mm; p &lt;<\/p>\n<p>0.01). Patients with melanosis coli had higher incidences of low-grade adenomas<\/p>\n<p>(31.1% vs 23.3%, p &lt; 0.05) and non-adenoma polyps (20.1% vs 12.8%, p &lt; 0.05) than<\/p>\n<p>the controls. On multivariate analysis, melanosis coli was independently associated<\/p>\n<p>with increased detecting rates of low grade adenoma (OR = 1.54; 95%: 1.06-2.23; p &lt;<\/p>\n<p>.05), non-adenoma polyp (OR = 1.72; 95%: 1.11-2.70; p &lt; .05) and numerous polyps<\/p>\n<p>(OR = 16.2, 95%: 3.66-71.6; p &lt; .05). There was no significant difference in the<\/p>\n<p>incidence of high-grade adenomas or adenocarcinomas in the two population groups,<\/p>\n<p>but the numbers of these lesions were insufficient to permit firm conclusions. No<\/p>\n<p>significant differences in incidence, number, and pathology of colorectal polyps<\/p>\n<p>between individuals with melanosis coli of three different grades of severity were found.<\/p>\n<p>Melanosis located predominantly in the right colon had an interestingly lower incidence<\/p>\n<p>of colonic polyps in right colon than did melanosis located predominantly in the left<\/p>\n<p>colon or total colon (8.9% vs. 26.3%, 24.0%, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with melanosis coli<\/p>\n<p>had significantly more nonspecific distal ileal ulcers than did controls (8.0% vs 0%, p &lt;<\/p>\n<p>0.001).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion: Melanosis coli is associated with a higher incidence and number of colonic<\/p>\n<p>non-adenoma polyps and low-grade adenomas, and higher incidence of distal ileal<\/p>\n<p>ulcers. Melanosis coli may not be a harmless pigmentation, but a sign of chronic injury<\/p>\n<p>of colonic and intestinal mucosa.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8113","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1507095051","protocol_affiliation":"The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China,The University of Hong Kong, HKSAR, China,The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.j6rcrd6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2u264y2v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","full_name":"Joe Fan","created_by":"Joe Fan","private_link":"A5AB5755F00BA6839C2FB9A7C653622F","original_img":"1","username":"joe-fan","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0186668","manuscript_citation":"Liu ZH,  Foo DCC,  Law WL,  Chan FSY,  Fan JKM,  Peng JS (2017) Melanosis coli: Harmless pigmentation?
