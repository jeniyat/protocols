However, after splitting, cells typically adhere better to a new plate with a lesser volume of medium compared to a greater volume. Thus, neurons plated on 6-well, 10-cm, or 15-cm dishes for biochemistry should be plated with 1.5 ml, 8 ml, and 18 ml of medium, respectively. These volumes should then be supplemented to the final volumes above on the day after plating.<\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":"","affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":787246,"guid":"5DFF6230AF1611E999501B4A56B6570A","previous_id":787245,"previous_guid":"47BADA40AF1611E999501B4A56B6570A","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"42B13FD187DB4151ACF3ADBB049361D6","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Culture maintenance"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"C639FD6BEB6D423CB0DEB2A961BF3523","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The next day (d4), aspirate medium and replace with pre-warmed MM supplemented with <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> laminin.<\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"27A45DB0AF1811E9BB29ABDEE1340738","order_id":2,"type_id":25,"title":"concentration","source":{"concentration":1,"unit":null,"title":""}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"5D6B26F2D7A74250930A72AAEB4AD691","order_id":3,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">For full medium changes, avoid drying wells by only aspirating one dish or a few wells at a time.

While a majority of these cells at Day 3 are committed to differentiation to post-mitotic neurons, a small subset may remain proliferative and can quickly overtake the culture.

Following BrdU treatment, medium should be completely exchanged the following day.

Laminincoated wells also support proliferative cells better than polymer without laminin, so BrdU is necessary in these conditions.While these substrates are stiffer than those under biological conditions, they reduce cell migration and clumping, facilitating imaging of individual cells. In our experience, PLO has produced the best neuronal morphology, but it is also the most sensitive to cell detachment resulting from medium exchanges. Detachment is a particular concern at high cell density and after extended time in culture, as the interconnected network of neural processes can cause entire wells to detach from the edges. PEI and PDL typically promote stronger adhesion, but PEI is toxic to cells if coating is not performed properly, and rapid degradation and batch-to-batch variability complicate the use of PDL. Cells are especially susceptible to detachment during the many washes required for immunocytochemistry, so these steps should be performed with extreme care. This protocol will assume use of PLO, although coating with PEI or PDL may be performed using an identical protocol except where noted.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1576695359}
