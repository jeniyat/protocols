Samples (n=100) of an Arab ethnic group from Kuwait were intially selected for the full\u00a0sequencing of the\u00a0 30 kb <em>LPL<\/em>\u00a0gene locus and flanking regions by Sanger sequencing across the 30 Kb<em>\u00a0<\/em>gene and its flanking sequences. A set of 76 primers were designed to cover the entire target sequence yielding on average between 500-700 bp PCR products inlcuding overlapping regions.\u00a0 The PCR products were then subjected to purification using nucleospin columns.\u00a0 Each sequence reaction was run in duplicates with one reaction including the forward primer and the other with the reverse primer for quality assurance. Sequence alignment was perfomed to compare the obtained sequences with\u00a0the genbank\u00a0reference sequence to screen and identify all varaints.\u00a0 A selected number of novel variants were selected for validation using realtime PCR.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9476","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1515398566","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kuwait University","affiliation":"Kuwait Univeristy","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mhcc32w","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Suzanne-y2x2c403s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Suzanne Albustan","created_by":"Suzanne Albustan","private_link":"B82E4D1216B5F9840455F37310F5B733","original_img":"1","username":"suzanne-albustan","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0192617","manuscript_citation":"Al-Bustan SA,  Al-Serri A,  Annice BG,  Alnaqeeb MA,  Al-Kandari WY,  Dashti M (2018) A novel <i>LPL<\/i> intronic variant: g.18704C>A identified by re-sequencing Kuwaiti Arab samples is associated with high-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride lipid levels.
