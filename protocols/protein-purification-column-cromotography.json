If the concentration of this protein is low, it is necessary to select the purification techniques appropriate for this protein to separate it from thousands of different proteins and to obtain it in pure form. The methods used in the purification of proteins are quite advanced.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> Today, many enzymes and non-enzyme proteins have been isolated in pure and crystalline form. To study the amino acid composition and sequence, molecular weight, and other physical properties of a protein, it is first necessary to purify the protein. In order to isolate proteins from a group of tissues and cells, there are certain procedures that should be done first. In the first stage, the tissue or cell group where the protein we want to work at most is selected. The tissue and cells are homogenized by using buffer solutions to keep the protein we are interested in. The cell membrane and the nucleus membrane must be broken down. This homogenate is then subjected to centrifugation at certain rates to remove cell particles. The resulting protein mixture is then removed in the supernatant state to purify the proteins in pure form using one or more of the purification methods.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557234056}
