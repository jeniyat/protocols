The study population was categorized according to exposure to earthquake and timing during gestation. Primary perinatal outcomes were gestational age at birth, birth weight, length and head circumference. Analyses adjusted for gender, gestational age at exposure, parity, maternal age and income.<\/p>\n<p>Results: A total of 1,966 eligible vaginal deliveries occurred during 2009 and 2,110 in 2010. Birth weight was not affected by the trimester of exposure; however, length, head circumference and gestational age at birth were significantly different according to trimester of exposure and gender of newborn. In multivariable analysis, newborns were shorter by 2 mm, 5 mm and 4.5 mm, if they were exposed during their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Furthermore, newborns had a smaller head circumference by 1.2 mm and 1.5 mm if they were exposed during first and second trimester of gestation.<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion: In this cohort, exposure to the February 2010 earthquake resulted in earlier delivery and reduced length and head circumference in the offspring. This association varied according to trimester of exposure and fetal gender. Health workers should include exposed to high levels of stress associated with natural disasters when assessing pregnancy risk factors.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8093","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1515271175","protocol_affiliation":"School of Nursing, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile,School of Education, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile,Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile,School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts,Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia,Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinica D\u00e1vila, Santiago, Chile","affiliation":"Universidad de los Andes","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mguc3ww","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Yasna-y2u264v2s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/006.png","full_name":"Yasna Palmeiro","created_by":"Yasna Palmeiro","private_link":"BB37991D592076C2E87736CC4E306507","original_img":"1","username":"yasna-palmeiro","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0191340","manuscript_citation":"Palmeiro-Silva YK,  Orellana P,  Venegas P,  Monteiro L,  Varas-Godoy M,  Norwitz E,  Rice G,  Osorio E,  Illanes SE (2018) Effects of earthquake on perinatal outcomes: A Chilean register-based study.
