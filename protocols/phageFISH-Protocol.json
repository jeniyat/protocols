Use NonPoly350Probe (Moraru<em> et al.<\/em>, 2010) as gene negative control. Probes (with Dig) are synthesized by incorporating Dig-&shy;\u2010dUTP into dsDNA via PCR (70 &micro;M Dig-&shy;\u2010dUTP), using the PCR Dig Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche, cat. no. 11636090910) according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. Targets (= PCR-&shy;\u2010amplified 300 bp target regions of the phage gene without Dig) are synthesized similarly as the probes, but without Dig-&shy;\u2010UTP in the PCR mix. The resulting PCR products are column-&shy;\u2010purified using the Gene Clean Turbo kit (Q-&shy;\u2010Biogene, cat. no. 1102-&shy;\u2010600), eluted in 1x TE, and checked electrophoretically in 2.5&minus;3% agarose gels, for size and Dig incorporation. The Dig-&shy;\u2010labelled probes position themselves at a higher position in the gel than the respective targets, a clear indication of Dig incorporation. The concentration of PCR products (probes and targets) is best determined using a Quant-&shy;\u2010iT<sup>TM<\/sup>Picogreen assay (Invitrogen, cat. no. P7589) or spectrophotometrically, using a NanoDrop instrument. The probes were stored at -&shy;\u201020 &deg;C.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>The conditions for hybridization need to be determined as described by Moraru and colleagues (2010). Firstly, the melting temperature (T<sub>m<\/sub>) for each probe&minus;target pair is calculated using the PolyPro software (Moraru<em> et al.<\/em>, 2011). Secondly, the melting temperatures (T<sub>m<\/sub>s) of the probe&minus;target hybrids are measured in a buffer with a similar composition to that of the hybridization buffer, using the Eco&trade; Real-&shy;\u2010Time PCR system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and&nbsp;SYTO 9 dye (Invitrogen, cat. no.

Unless stated otherwise, perform incubations at room temperature (RT). All washing steps are carried out in\u00a050 ml volumes, in plastic Petri dishes, when the steps are performed at RT or in the oven, or in\u00a050 ml Falcon tubes, when incubation in a water bath is necessary.<br \/> <br \/> Buffers containing dextran sulfate (DS) are prepared ahead (details see below). First, dissolve the DS at 48 \u00b0C (Sigma, cat. no. D8906) in buffer components, with the exception of formamide, SDS and blocking reagents. Second, when the DS is completely dissolved, cool the solution to RT and add the rest of the components. After preparation, formamide-\u00adcontaining buffers are stored at -\u00ad20 \u00b0C, while formamide-\u00adfree buffers are filtered sterilized (0.2 \u00b5m) and kept at 4 \u00b0C.<br \/> <br \/> Unless specifically indicated in the protocol, the samples are not allowed to dry at any time during the procedure. Drying is especially dangerous during hybridization or Catalyzed Reporter Deposition (CARD) reactions, when it could cause high background to form. To avoid drying, do all incubations by completely immersing the filters in the respective buffers. When smaller volumes of buffers are used and the incubation is done at a higher temperature and\/or for a longer time, the samples need to be placed in humidity chambers. A humidity chamber can be any tightly closed container that seals with a silicone O-\u00adring. For low temperature incubations (e.g., RT, 37 \u00b0C, or 46 \u00b0C), polypropylene containers can be used. However, for high temperature incubations (e.g., 85 \u00b0C), containers made of glass (lid can be of polypropylene) are recommended to avoid deformation of the container and drying of the samples. To create humidity in the chamber, line the bottom with lint-free tissues such as Kimwipes soaked in water or, when the buffers contain formamide or paraformaldehyde, in a formamide-\u00adwater or paraformaldehyde-\u00adwater solution of the same concentration as the buffer. For samples immobilized on filters (see section on infected\u00a0Pseudoalteromonas\u00a0cells), place the filters face-\u00adup in Petri dishes, cover them with buffer, and then place the Petri dishes in humidity chambers. For samples directly immobilized on slides (see section on detection of free phage), cover the sample area (marked with a PAP pen, Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. no. 71310)\u00a0with buffer and place the slide in a humidity chamber (usually on top of a PCR tube rack).<br \/> <br \/> After being dissolved in water, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-\u00adabeled\u00a0oligonucleotides or antibodies are stored at 4 \u00b0C for no longer than 6 months. Vortexing should be avoided and mixing is performed by pipetting up and down or gently inverting the tubes.<br \/> <br \/> Prepare Alexa488\u00a0and Alexa594tyramides as described by Pernthaler and Pernthaler\u00a0(2005). The stocks of fluorochrome-\u00adabeled chemicals are stored in the dark. Excessive light exposure during the procedure is to be avoided.\u00a0<br \/> <br \/> The antibody step promotes the formation of false positives. These are more likely to appear when the cells are damaged during the phageFISH procedure, particularly during the acid treatments (necessary for the inactivation of the HRP, endogenous and introduced with the rRNA targeting probes) and denaturation step. Therefore, the strength of permeabilization, inactivation of peroxidases (by acid treatments or otherwise) and denaturation time must be carefully optimized to minimize damage to cells.\u00a0<br \/> <br \/> <strong>phageFISH on infected\u00a0Psuedoalteromonas\u00a0cells (I):<br \/><br \/><\/strong>SAMPLE FIXATION. \u00a0Fix cells by adding paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. no.

The Alexa488\u00a0filter set is used for detection of the 16S rRNA signals, while the Alexa594\u00a0filter set is used for detection of the phage gene signals. Both for cell counts and image processing, take photomicrographs with a black and white digital camera, e.g., AxioCamMn (Carl Zeiss, Germany), using the AxioVision 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). To capture both the strong, cell wide and the weak, dot-\u00adlike phage signals, take a series of images with increasing exposure times (e.g. 3 ms, 5 ms, 7 ms, 10\u00a0ms, 15 ms, 25 ms, 40 ms, 50 ms, 75 ms, 100 ms and 140 ms ) for the Alexa594\u00a0filter set. Then have the black and white photomicrographs pseudo-\u00adcolored automatically by the software used for acquisition, green for the 16S rRNA and red for the phage signals. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br \/> <br \/> COUNTING. \u00a0Count signals on photomicrographs, by manually marking the cells in the Alexa488\u00a0channel and the corresponding gene signals in the Alexa594\u00a0channel with the \u201cEvents\u201d tool from the \u201cMeasure\u201d menu. The number of events is determined using the \u201cmeasure events\u201d function. Count at least 800 cells per sample. Always correct the number of infected cells for the number of false positives found in the negative control (infected cells hybridized with the\u00a0NonPoly350Pr probe).\u00a0<br \/><br \/>IMAGE PROCESSING. \u00a0The processing of the images of phageFISH preparations is divided into two stages: (i) exporting selected fields of view using the Zen Lite 2011 software (Blue edition; Carl Zeiss, Germany), and (ii) reconstructing composite images from the original images of the exposure time series using the PaintShop Photo Pro X4 software (Corel Corporation, USA). More specifically, in the event that the signals in the Alexa594\u00a0filter set are characterized by different sizes and intensities in such a way that the exposure times at which the large signals are not overexposed did not allow the small signals to be visible, while the exposure times at which the small signals were visible resulted in a serious overexposure of the large signals, some image processing, i.e., image reconstruction from several images, is\u00a0recommended in order to achieve a representative image for documentation. To reconstruct the image, devise a High Dynamic Range Imaging protocol. Accordingly, images with increasing exposure times are loaded as separate layers. First, different elements composing an image are identified. Then, for each element, the layer where the element was clearly visible, but not overexposed, is selected. The elements are merged into one new image, by transferring the information from the higher exposure layers to the lower exposure layers, using the \u201cEraser\u201d tool. At the end, a sharpening filter and a black threshold are applied on the reconstructed images. The overlay between the green 16S rRNA signals and the red phage signals is generated by visualizing the layers with the \u201cLighten\u201d function.<br \/> <br \/> <strong>References:<\/strong><br \/><br \/>Amann, R., Binder, B.J., Olson, R.J., Chisholm, S.W., Devereux, R., and Stahl, D.A.
