SGs are related to multiple diseases, but there are no reports of the existence of SGs in atrial fibrillation (AF); hence, the effects of SGs in AF are still unknown. <br \/>Methods and results: Cell models of AF were established by field stimulation at 600 times per minute. HL-1 cells, cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA and G3bP1-cDNA plasmid by Lipofectamine 2000. The presence of SGs was detected by immunofluorescence staining against GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP-1) and electron microscopy. Stable HL-1 cell lines transfected with lentivirus overexpressing G3BP1 (pEGFP-LV-G3BP1) were constructed to further investigate the role of SGs in AF. The effects of SGs on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload in tachypaced HL-1 cells were studied by flow cytometry. The effects of SGs on cardiac fibroblast proliferation and the protein expression level of collagen I\/III and fibronectin-1 were also studied. Here, we first showed that SGs detected by G3BP1 and PABP-1 are present and markedly elevated in both tachypaced mouse cardiomyocytes and HL-1 atrial cells. The presence of SGs in tachypaced atrial myocytes was also confirmed by electron microscopy. SG formation in HL-1 cells with G3BP1 overexpression significantly inhibited the rapid pacing-induced increase in ROS level and attenuated calcium overload (all P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, SGs inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation (P&lt;0.05) and decreased the protein expression level of collagen I\/III and fibronectin-1 in cardiac fibroblasts stimulated by angiotensin II (all P&lt;0.05). <br \/>Conclusions: SGs are rapidly induced and present in AF, and upregulation of SGs confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress, calcium overload and atrial fibrosis in AF. <\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"127880","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"  anti-G3BP1and anti-PABP1 primary antibodies","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"22","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.abcam.com","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Abcam","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"127881","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"DCFH-DA, DAPI, Claycomb medium, fetal bovine serum","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"298","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.sigmaaldrich.com\/","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Sigma \u2013 Aldrich","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"127882","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Lipofectamine 2000","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"11","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.lifetechnologies.com","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Life Technologies","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"127883","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"DMEM, Pancreatin ","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"137","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.thermofisher.com\/de\/de\/home\/brands\/gibco.html","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Gibco - Thermo Fischer","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":null,"version_class":"14837","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1534678923","protocol_affiliation":"medoven@163.com,1432297247@qq.com,18246120236@163.com,dr.hanwei@foxmail.com","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.sqvedw6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t234x2w2z2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","full_name":"wei han","created_by":"wei han","private_link":"855B8613104D77CFB25A1378FBDAF954","original_img":"1","username":"wei-han1","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":341204,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Atrial fibrillation, Stress granules, G3BP1, Oxidative stress","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Guo Dong,Fengying Liang,Chengcheng Wang,Wei Han","authors_list":[{"name":"Guo Dong","affiliation":"medoven@163.com","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Fengying Liang","affiliation":"1432297247@qq.com","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Chengcheng Wang","affiliation":"18246120236@163.com","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Wei Han","affiliation":"dr.hanwei@foxmail.com","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","username":"wei-han1","full_name":"wei han","created_by":"wei han"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[]}
