Both strains were originally isolated from the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Suttle and Chen 1992). The host was maintained as a \u201380\u00b0C glycerol stock to minimize any long-term culturing effects and was cultivated at 30\u00b0C with agitation (120\u2013200 rpm) using Marine Luria-Bertani broth (MLB) (0.5 g L<sup>\u20131<\/sup> each of casamino acids, peptone, and yeast extract, 0.3% vol\/vol glycerol, in 25 psu ultrafiltrate base). The virus was amplified using the plate lysate\/liquid elution method (Suttle 1993), substituting ultrafiltered (virus-free) seawater for sterile media as the eluting agent. The eluant from multiple plates was pooled into a 50-mL centrifuge tube and spun at ~4000g for 20 min to remove large debris. The supernatant was then collected and filtered through a 47-mm\u2013diameter, 0.22-\u00b5m\u2013pore-size Durapore (Millipore) membrane to remove any remaining host cells.
