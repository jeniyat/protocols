In the table above, we have used 14 cycles (2 cycles at 57 \u00b0C and 12 cycles at 65 \u00b0C annealing temperature) as an example.

Relying solely on unbiased sampling to characterize cellular niches becomes infeasible, as the marginal utility of collecting more cells diminishes quickly. Furthermore, in many clinical samples, the relevant cell types are scarce and efficient processing is critical. We developed an integrated pipeline for index sorting and massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (MARS-seq2.0) that builds on our previously published MARS-seq approach. MARS-seq2.0 is based on >1 million cells sequenced with this pipeline and allows identification of unique cell types across different tissues and diseases, as well as unique model systems and organisms. Here, we present a detailed step-by-step procedure for applying the method. In the improved procedure, we combine sub-microliter reaction volumes, optimization of enzymatic mixtures and an enhanced analytical pipeline to substantially lower the cost, improve reproducibility and reduce well-to-well contamination. Data analysis combines multiple layers of quality assessment and error detection and correction, graphically presenting key statistics for library complexity, noise distribution and sequencing saturation. Importantly, our combined FACS and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) workflow enables intuitive approaches for depletion or enrichment of cell populations in a data-driven manner that is essential to efficient sampling of complex tissues. The experimental protocol, from cell sorting to a ready-to-sequence library, takes 2\u20133 d.

Then the single cells are pooled together, using a liquid-handling robot for subsequent molecular reactions to be performed on the pooled and labeled material. Each group of single cells amplified together is referred to as an \u2018amplification batch\u2019. The pooled cDNA is converted into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and is linearly amplified by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription (IVT). The amplified RNA (aRNA) is fragmented and a pool barcode is added by RNA\u2013DNA ligation, allowing efficient sequencing of 8,000\u201310,000 cells in a single run. Illumina adaptors are then added by RT and PCR, which enables quantification of the mRNA (Fig. 2). During library preparation, we routinely evaluate the complexity of the libraries, yielding a quality control (QC) score that is used to monitor MARS-seq2.0 performance before sequencing. On the basis of these scores, amplified libraries suitable for sequencing of 20\u201340 384-well plates are pooled and sequenced together on a single flow cell. Sequenced reads are automatically processed in the MARS-seq2.0 computational pipeline (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/compgenomics.weizmann.ac.il\/tanay\/?\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">http:\/\/compgenomics.weizmann.ac.il\/tanay\/?<\/span><\/a><span> page_id=672), in which the molecular signal is separated from the background noise.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/a46f459508ecc97a272dd84ceca048997b7960cbda5add162664b220d1dea5d6\/bre27vcw.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Optimization of MARS-seq<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Background noise is a major problem in all massively parallel single-cell protocols. Our prior study<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">10 <\/span><span>suggested that this cell-to-cell contamination noise could partially be associated with a molecular process that randomly links a gene, a UMI and a cell barcode during library preparation. To enhance the experimental stability and detection rate while controlling for potential sources of systematic noise in MARS-seq2.0, we set out to optimize RNA retention and amplification. Starting from the MARSseq protocol, we optimized all steps of the single-cell processing, including lysis conditions, reaction volume, primer design and the composition of enzymatic reactions. We evaluated the possibility of reducing the RT reaction volume by analyzing 768 single mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells: after sorting, we performed complete evaporation of the 2 \u03bcl of lysis buffer containing the RT primer at 95 \u00b0C, followed by addition of 0.5 \u03bcl of RT mix, using a liquid-handling robot. For these conditions, RT primer quantities were considerably reduced. In low-volume reactions, we did not observe a substantial increase in the number of molecules measured per cell as compared with those of high-volume reactions, but rather saw an improved signal-to-noise ratio as evaluated by the number of molecules in the wells containing cells as compared with our negative-control empty wells (Supplementary Fig. 2a). This is also a consequence of the 200-fold reduction in the RT primer final concentration that prevents well-to-well contamination during the pooling and downstream enzymatic reactions. In addition, such low-volume reactions are cost effective (reducing enzyme consumption) and scalable. Because second-strand-synthesis enzymes are potentially a major sensitivity-limiting factor but can also generate unwanted background noise post pooling, we further evaluated several different second-strand-synthesis mixtures. We observed a small but considerable inverse correlation between the number of molecules obtained in the different conditions and the signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting that although some mixtures may be slightly more efficient in converting the hybrid RNA\u2013cDNA template into a double-stranded DNA, this is accompanied by unwanted hybrid molecular products reaching a noise level of up to 40 % of the true signal in several of the mixtures (Supplementary Fig. 2b). These results demonstrate that it is critical to optimize and control for noise level in scRNA-seq analysis and that this factor can be affected by various steps during single-cell library production.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Key procedural advancements in MARS-seq2.0<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">MARS-seq2.0 introduces important modifications of the MARS-seq method in almost every part of the protocol.

To visually relate the number of molecules per cell (Supplementary Fig. 3a) to the original single-cell position on the 384-well plate matrix, a plate-view heat-map is generated that shows how the number of recovered genes and spike-in molecules are distributed across the plate position. This can highlight potential sorting, robotic or other problems. Although technical QC is critical, as demonstrated above, we stress that the ultimate way to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific scRNA-seq method is to examine the novelty and richness of the biological insights emerging from the data and that these may depend on multiple factors, including the quality of biological materials.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Strengths and limitations of the protocol<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The key strengths of MARS-seq2.0 are as follows:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">The combination of indexed FACS sorting and scRNA-seq enables refinement and enrichment of the cells of interest, which is especially critical for analysis of rare subpopulations and processing of rare cells in human clinical samples.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span>The improvements made in MARS-seq2.0 provide a cost-effective library preparation method that allows analysis of any number of single cells without compromising the cost per cell value.
