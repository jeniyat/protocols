In a study made by Vincent J et al. they examined 10 069 patients admitted to the ICU in Europe, Asia, Middle East, Oceania and Africa. The study suggests significant between-country variations in the risk of in-hospital death. They concluded that their findings highlight a significant association and stepwise increase between risk of death and the global national income and suggest that the ICU organization has a vital effect on the risk of death.
