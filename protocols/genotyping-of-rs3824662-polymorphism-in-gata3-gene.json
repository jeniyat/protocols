G\/T allele-specific primer is very sensitive and binds only with the DNA fragments containing G\/T nucleotide template DNA. Forward outer and reverse outer primers will amplify a specific 691 base pair region of GATA3. This 691 base pair region contains the desired polymorphic site of interest. Allele-specific primers produce 506 bp products upon the presence of either a G allele or T allele. PCR reaction in a total volume of 15 \u03bcL with an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 45 s at 55\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C, and a final extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C will produce better reproducible result. The reaction mixture contains both forward outer and reverse outer primers and contains either the G allele-specific forward inner primer or the T allele-specific forward inner primer. Primer concentration used was 200 nM each. When the G allele is present in a specific DNA sequence, only the 506 base pair band will be found upon gel electrophoresis of PCR amplicons with the G allele-specific primer. In this case, no such 506 base pair band will be obtained upon gel electrophoresis with the T allele-specific primer. On the other hand, for mutant TT genotypes, the opposite phenomenon will occur when the T allele is present, which will be reflected by the presence of the 506 base pair DNA band. In the case of the heterozygous genotype (GT), both inner primers for G and T alleles will bind with specific DNA sequences to produce 506 base pair bands.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>Take precaution as required\u00a0for a general PCR reaction.<\/p>","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"43741","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"GoTaq(R) G2 Hot Start Green Master Mix, 1,000 reactions","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"M7423","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"23","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.promega.com","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Promega","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"44245","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Agarose, LE, Analytical Grade, 500gm","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"V3125","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"23","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.promega.com","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Promega","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"47811","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Ethidium bromide [EB, EtBr]","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"EB0195.SIZE.25g","reagent_url":"https:\/\/www.biobasic.com\/us\/ethidium-bromide-eb-etbr-4178","reagent_vendor_id":"120","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/biobasic.com\/","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Bio Basic Inc.","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"118981","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"primers","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":"<p>1.
