Detection of AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aim of this study is to develop a screening model for detecting AF in a primary health care setting and to start oral anticoagulant therapy in high risk patients to prevent stroke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods and Findings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A cross-sectional study. All of 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary health care centre in Stockholm were invited to AF screening upon visiting the centre during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the centre during this period were invited to participate by letter. Intermittent ECG recording, 30 seconds twice a day, using a hand-held Zenicor device over a 2-week period, was offered to participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.<\/p>\n<p>A total number of 324 (78.1%) out of 415 identified persons participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female and the median CHA2DS2-VASc was 3. Previously diagnosed AF was found in 34 (8.2%) persons in the target population. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of new AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy was successful 88% of patients with newly detected AF.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The AF screening project showed a high participation rate and yielded a high rate of newly discovered AF of which 88% were able to be treated with oral anticoagulant.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"10023","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1517677336","protocol_affiliation":"Karolinska Institute Stockholm","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.m2fc8bn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2y2a4w2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Faris Ghazal","created_by":"Faris Ghazal","private_link":"8C4720310F364FAB4CF9B83C42294BE6","original_img":"1","username":"faris-ghazal","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0198069<\/p>","journal_name":"PLOS One","is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":286758,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Anticoagulation, atrial fibrillation, electrocardiogram, primary care, screening, stroke","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Faris Ghazal","authors_list":[{"name":"Faris Ghazal","affiliation":"Karolinska Institute Stockholm","username":"faris-ghazal","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","username":"faris-ghazal","full_name":"Faris Ghazal","created_by":"Faris Ghazal"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"606688","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"BF34073A0AF14064A03274B75B345336","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1517678304","components":[{"component_id":"1052257","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"2F9434350CD147E8AB75298BF3D8FE7F","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Design and Selection","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Design and Selection"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1052256","previous_id":"1052257","original_id":"0","guid":"4F00CB2BCFD94F9EBF78F013FAE0223C","previous_guid":"2F9434350CD147E8AB75298BF3D8FE7F","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p><strong>Design: <\/strong>Cross sectional screening study.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Study population: <\/strong>All individuals born 1941 to 1945 and who were registered at H\u00f6gdalen Primary Health Care Centre in Stockholm during 2015.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inclusion criteria: <\/strong>All individuals in the target population who agreed to participate in the study.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Screening period: <\/strong>From February, 2015 to February, 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ethics approvals: <\/strong>This study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki declaration.
