To make plant collections valuable for current and future researchers, both the physical specimen and all associated data must be of the highest quality. This protocol describes the steps by which researchers at Denver Botanic Gardens make vascular plant specimen collections and record associated data.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1561048294}
