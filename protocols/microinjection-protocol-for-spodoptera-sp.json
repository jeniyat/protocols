This protocol describe a simple and unique protocol for microinjecting <em>Spodoptera frugiperda<\/em>. Insect eggs with thin chorions such as <em>S. frugiperda<\/em> or with chorions that are removable can be sensitive to desiccation, resulting in death of the embyro. To control or prevent excessive desiccation, eggs can be covered with liquid during the microinjection process.\u00a0 <em>Spodoptera frugiperda<\/em> are relatively large insect eggs (about 400\u03bcm in diameter) and because the chorion does not have to be removed it is somewhat less sensitive to desiccation during the microinjection process.\u00a0 However, injecting <em>S. frugiperda<\/em> eggs in the absence of any fluid covering resulted in rapid clogging of injection needles due to rapid drying of residual ooplasm onto the outside of the needle. So, seek for alternative covering liquid became a demand to overcome the lethal effect of the conventional covering liquid in order to developed microinjection and delivering system for the target insect emberyo. New liquids were tested for their compatibility with <em>S. frugiperda<\/em> viability. Halocarbon oils (either low viscosity #27 or high viscosity #700) which are used routinely during the microinjection of some Diptera, allowed for easy injections but were lethal to <em>S. frugiperda<\/em> embryos even after removing as much of the residual oil as possible immediately following injection. Alternatively, an emulsion of halocarbon oil and water; polysorbate 20 (Tween 20<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>); was used and didn\u2019t affect on egg viability (90% hatch rate), while it causes turbidity and made injections more difficult due to the obstructed visibility. Finally, dilution of honey was found to a very effective medium with which to temporarily cover the eggs during injection resulting in a 100% survival rate of properly aged embryos. The solutions viscosity was similar to halocarbon oil #27 and this allowed the honey solution to completely cover the eggs without flowing off of the eggs and onto the glass slide. There were no problems with injection needles clogging due to ooplasm adhering and drying on the outside of the needle, and the honey solution was readily removed immediately after injection. Prolonged (24hrs or longer) exposure of developing embryos to the honey solution was detrimental to embryonic development and led eventually to death of the embryos before hatching and therefore it was removed immediately after eggs were injected.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"1","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>1- Collect deposited egg in early stage (1 hour).<\/p>\n<p>2- prepare needles. <\/p>\n<p>3-Prior to injection <em>Spodoptera Sp.<\/em> eggs, it should be covered with a liquid to control desiccation and facilitate the injection process.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"119098","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Natural Honey","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"119167","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"polysorbate 20 ","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"74","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.sigmaaldrich.com\/","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Sigma-aldrich","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":"","version_class":"9197","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1513417165","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Pests and Plant Protection, Agricultural & Biological Division, National Research Centre, Egypt,Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology, Department of Entomology, University of Maryland College Park, US","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.manc2de","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2w2a4w2y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rdbihp6.jpg","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Nesreen Abd El-Ghany","created_by":"Nesreen Abd El-Ghany","private_link":"AFE260B806F33AB7D77F9CC13BBF3764","original_img":"1","username":"nesreen-abd-elghany","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Under publication<\/p>","journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":277783,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[{"protocol_id":"9265","protocol_name":"Microinjection protocol for Spodoptera Sp.","protocol_name_html":"Microinjection protocol for Spodoptera Sp.","uri":"microinjection-protocol-for-spodoptera-sp-marc2d6","full_name":"Nesreen Abd El-Ghany","affiliation":null,"affiliation_url":null,"username":"nesreen-abd-elghany"}],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"86","group_uri":"protocolsio","group_name":"protocols.io news","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/8ij.png","requested_uid":"33719","request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"1","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"big_protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rdaihp6.jpg","big_protocol_img_ofn":"figure1.jpg","is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Nesreen M.
