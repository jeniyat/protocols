As such, Black women use a variety of hair products, which often contain more endocrine-disrupting chemicals than products used by women of other races. An emerging body of research is linking chemicals in hair products to breast cancer, but there is no validated instrument that measures constructs related to hair, identity, and breast health. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the Black Identity, Hair Product Use, and Breast Cancer Scale (BHBS) in a diverse sample of Black women to measure the social and cultural constructs associated with Black women\u2019s hair product use and perceived breast cancer risk. <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods<\/span><span>: Participants completed a 27-item scale that queried perceptions of identity, hair products, and breast cancer risk.
