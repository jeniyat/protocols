Conversely, seeding them too sparsely will result in few survivals. In my experience, the optimum is between 1:10 and 1:15 (provided that you are using RevitaCell or another ROCK inhibitor). For example, I typically take 150 \u03bcl (for 1:10) or 100 \u03bcl (for 1:15) from the 1.5 ml cell suspension. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":769660,"guid":"8BFC37F0980D11E9ACC911F96FF1728E","previous_id":769659,"previous_guid":"48B6D810980D11E9ACC911F96FF1728E","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"54A5981E64484F6F9D175A304ADC33EF","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Cell dissociation"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D5195AD636CC476A957104CE6A6C8BAF","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Inspect the cells under the microscope to ensure that the clumps are of the right size (50-200 \u03bcl).
