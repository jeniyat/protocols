Protocol<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All sampling procedures in this protocol have been designed to be conducted in commercial production facilities while birds are housed.<\/p>\n<p>No sampling at height is required to obtain sufficient samples representative of the house or the flock to be sampled.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Animal Welfare<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This prtocol is designed to minimise adverse interference with birds while they are housed.<\/p>\n<p>Sampling is conducted at routine times when birds would be normally inspected by farm staff.<\/p>\n<p>No birds are directly handled during the sampling procedure, however they will be walked through during sampling within sheds.<\/p>\n<p>Walking pace should be maintained, and it is recommended that sampling be conducted when birds are being routinely checked to minimise flock disturbance.<\/p>\n<p>Samples can be obtained by collection of materials that are routinely used or disposed of during production, such as hatch debris or chick papers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Repeated Sampling<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Where sampling is to be conducted repeatedly in the same environment, it is recommended that sampling be conducted at the same time of the day on each sampling ocassion to eliminate sampling or operator bias.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure repeatability between sampling events, select the same sites to be sampled on each sampling ocassion.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To ensure this, identify simple to access sampling locations prior to sampling.<\/p>\n<p>Top ensure adequate sample is collected during sampling samples should be collected from sites dispersed evenly along the length of the shed or within the environment to be sampled.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To ensure repeatability within the shed, it is easier if the sampling sites are collected from the same site, the length of the equipment or at an easily identifiable site such as the end of a cage frame.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid sampling at height if possible.<\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":null,"status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"618318","is_changed":"0","original_id":"618230","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"A0B13BEEEFDE44729034B69A5D9D1C44","previous_guid":"7309160A43D84DA6ADA28180DE97782A","previous_id":"618326","last_modified":"1522634860","components":[{"component_id":"1082257","previous_id":0,"original_id":"1081992","guid":"9070A0C97D9B42F2953DDE2DCA3463C2","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Parent
