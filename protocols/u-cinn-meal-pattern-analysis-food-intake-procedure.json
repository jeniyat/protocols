balance with a resolution of 0.01g. Feeders are designed to account for spillage of food and to prevent foraging, a combination which provides the most accurate food intake monitor on the market.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">\n<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Food Access Control<\/span><span> - Access to food can be placed under automatic computerized control. A pneumatic driven shield prevents access to the food, and can be controlled by times intervals and\/or by mass of food. Additionally, this option also includes paradigms for Yolked or Paired feeding.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">\n<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Center Feeder Cages: <\/span><span>The Center Feeder Cage maintains the same sealed environment but adds a feeder to the center of the cage to allow food intake measurements. The Center Feeder is the most popular and universal in application, supporting all subject body types from lean to obese. An adjustable food guard allows mechanical fine tuning of food access to minimize foraging.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557409338}
