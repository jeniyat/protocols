The procedures will be explained to the subjects previous and risks and benefits will be also explained. The subjects will be voluntary to participate in the study and should accept by signing the informed consent form. This must include the methodological design and the experimental procedures.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The study will consist in a quasi-experimental research that aims to verify the changes in health status and physical fitness after 12 weeks of water aerobics lessons. The variables that we intend to measure could be categorized into different groups, namely, i) anthropometry, with the measurement of height, body mass by bioimpedance, and circumferences (waist and hip); ii) physical condition, through the evaluation of the explosive strength of the upper limbs (3-kg medicine ball throwing) and lower limbs (countermovement jump), endurance strength of the upper limbs (maximum number of arm pushups) and the lower limbs (chair -stand test) and cardiorespiratory fitness evaluation (YMCA 3-min step-test); iii) lipid profile (triglycerides and cholesterol) and blood pressure. These variables will be assessed during the week before the program implementation (week 0 - pre-training) and the week after the end of the program (week 13 - post-training). The evaluations will be developed on two different days separated by 72 hours. On the first day, the participants\u2019 anthropometric characteristics, lipid profile and blood pressure should be measured, followed by an assessment of explosive strength of the upper and lower limbs. On the second day of assessment, endurance strength and cardiorespiratory tests should be performed. All variables will be assessed by experienced researchers and scientific, valid and reliable methods will be used to measure those variables (ACSM, 2013; Mayhew et al., 1997; Rikli et al., 1999; Stewart et al., 2011). In every evaluation the participant will be allowed to rest for fully recover from the previous evaluation. The subjects will be instructed in advance to refrain from exercise, alcohol and caffeine consumption during the evaluation period.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The potential subjects will be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.\u00a0The teachers of water-aerobics classes will also be informed of everything and will be free to accept or give up of the study procedures. No external pressure will be made to conditioning teacher activity, being free to choose and implement the program exercitation that usually is performed. \u00a0The contact of main researcher and project responsible will be available for participants and for the institution. One sport academy will be contacted, and the classes will be chosen randomly from the same institution. Participants of different classes will be informed about the study and once they agreed, they will be part of the research.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The researchers involved will be experienced and aware of society and ethical considerations, that must always take precedence over laws and regulations and procedures. Also, the research will careful assess risks and benefits and will probably benefit the population studied. The confidentiality of data is guaranteed by all researchers that will signed a responsibility term before the beginning of the data collection.<\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"609922","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"0173CF27E1AB4EC69DBA94F8ECDF85D4","previous_guid":"512F2EAA42EA413CA8A90A9D52A5B9E6","previous_id":"609921","last_modified":"1519080626","components":[{"component_id":"1060401","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"CA9D177A5CD9400A96BE3335314830D8","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"References","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"References"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1060400","previous_id":"1060401","original_id":"0","guid":"89A93645BA6F4D8E97D90C84BD95C41C","previous_guid":"CA9D177A5CD9400A96BE3335314830D8","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>American College of Sports Medicine.\u00a0ACSM's guidelines for exercise testing and prescription. 9<sup>th<\/sup> ed.
