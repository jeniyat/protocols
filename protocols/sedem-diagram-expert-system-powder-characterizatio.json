Ph. (Ph Eur, 2011) Tapped density (Dc): The method is described in Section 2.9.34 of Eur. Ph.

This is calculated from Da and Dc as: IH=Dc\/Da<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Angle of repose (\u03b1) (Rubinstein, 1993, Mu\u00f1oz, 1993). The method is described in Section 2.9.36 of Eur Ph (Ph Eur, 2011). This is the angle of the cone formed when the product is passed through a funnel with the following dimensions: height 9.5 cm, upper diameter of spout 7.2 cm, internal diameter at the bottom, narrow end of spout 1.8 cm. The funnel is placed on a support 20 cm above the table surface, centred over a millimetre-grid sheet on which two intersecting lines are drawn, crossing at the centre. The spout is plugged and the funnel is filled with the product until it is flush with the top end of the spout when smoothed with a spatula. Remove the plug and allow the powder to fall onto the millimetre sheet. Measure the four radii of the cone base with a slide calliper and calculate the mean value (r). Measure the cone height (h). Deduce \u03b1 from tan(\u03b1)=h\/r.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Flowability (t\u2033): The method is described in Section 2.9.16 of Eur. Ph (Ph Eur, 2011). It is expressed in seconds and tenths of a second per 100 grams of sample, with a mean value of three measurements.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Loss on drying (%HR): This is measured by the method described in 2.2.32 in Eur. Ph (Ph Eur, 2011). The sample is dried in an oven at 105 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, until a constant weight is obtained.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hygroscopicity (%H): Determination of the percentage increase in sample weight after being kept in a humidifier at a relative humidity of 76% (\u00b12%) and a temperature of 22\u00b0C\u00b1 2\u00b0C for 24 h.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Percentage of particles measuring &lt;50 \u03bcm (%Pf): Particle size is determined by means of the sieve test following the General method 2.9.12 of Eur. Ph. (Ph Eur, 2011). The value returned is the % of particles that pass through a 0.05-mm sieve when vibrated for 10 min at speed 10 (CISA vibrator).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Homogeneity index (I\u03b8): This is calculated according to the General method 2.9.12 of Eur. Ph (Ph Eur, 2011). To determine particle size by means of the sieve test, the grain size of a 100g sample is measured by subjecting a sieve stack to vibration for 10 min at speed 10 (CISA vibrator). The sieve sizes used are 0.355 mm, 0.212 mm, 0.100 mm and 0.05 mm. The percentage of product retained in each sieve is calculated and the amount that passes through the 0.05mm sieve is measured. The percentage of fine particles (&lt;50 \u03bcm) (%Pf) was calculated as described above. Note that if this percentage is higher than that calculated in the complete sieve test, it is because some of the particles become adhered to the product retained in the sieves during the grain-size test, and the percentage of &lt;50 \u03bcm particles found may be lower than the true figure. The following equation is then applied to the data obtained.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/4gm2rp6.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/4gm2rp6.jpg\" data-ofn=\"equation Homogeneity Index.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Where: I\u03b8, Relative homogeneity index.
