All samples, before use in experiments, were screened for the endogenous presence of PWH3a using the FLVP assay.<br \/><br \/>In the first experiment, where the added (exogenous) bacterium did not dominate the system, PWH3a was added to a final concentration of 6.3 \u00d7 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells mL<sup>\u20131<\/sup> in 500 mL of a natural background of prokaryotes at a final concentration of 2.1 \u00d7 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells mL<sup>\u20131<\/sup> (~3:1 final ratio PWH3a:natural). The microcosm was enriched with MLB (10% final concentration) and incubated at 20\u00b0C with a 14:10 h light:dark cycle. Subsamples were taken at ~24-h intervals for prokaryotic cell counts (see Suttle and Fuhrman 2010, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aslo.org\/books\/mave\/\" target=\"_blank\">this volume<\/a>) and FLVP assays.

The microcosm was enriched as before and maintained at the same light level as the previous microcosm, yet the incubation was at the higher temperature of 30\u00b0C with aeration. Subsamples were taken as before, and infection of the microcosm was performed shortly after the 48-h time point with the same concentration of PWH3a-P1 virus as above.\u00a0<br \/><br \/><strong>FLVP receptor titration experiment:<\/strong> <br \/><br \/>Four flasks of 10 mL sterile MLB were inoculated with PWH3a at a final concentration of 1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells mL<sup>\u20131<\/sup>. FLVPs were added to three of the flasks at the following MOIs: 0 (uncoated control), 1000, and 10, to attempt to coat the PWH3a bacterium\u2019s cell surface receptors and render it resistant to subsequent infection. PWH3a-P1 virus was then added to the three flasks at an MOI of 0.01\u20130.1. The fourth flask did not contain any FLVPs or PWH3a-P1 and served as the control.
