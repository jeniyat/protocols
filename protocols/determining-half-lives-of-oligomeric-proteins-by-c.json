In the case of oligomeric proteins, these methods do not differentiate whether the stabilities of the monomeric versus oligomeric forms of the protein differ. This method describes how to determine the half-lives of oligomeric proteins that are stable in the presence of low concentrations of the detergent SDS by combining cycloheximide blocking with non-dissociating Western blot (Dutta et al., 2011). The addition of cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis and non-dissociating Western blot uses low concentrations of SDS to separate stable oligomers from monomers. The amount of the protein of interest detected in samples taken at different times after adding cycloheximide can be used to determine the half-life of the oligomeric protein.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>References<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Byk, L., Iglesias, N., De Maio, F., Gebhard, L., Rossi, M. and Gamarnik, A.
