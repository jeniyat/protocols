The template illustrates potential technical, conceptual,\u00a0and aesthetic inputs derived from the new-media arts lab. On the other\u00a0hand, three output channels have been emphasized to contribute to the\u00a0core of the stem cells research, public engagement, and the core of the\u00a0research in new-media arts.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"12191","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1526407601","protocol_affiliation":"New Media Arts, Helwan University","affiliation":"Helwan University","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.p57dq9n","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Diaa-y20354z2w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/t8fjc96.jpg","full_name":"Diaa Ahmedien","created_by":"Diaa Ahmedien","private_link":"6606D61B58E44F8AE6CE54186C0ED381","original_img":"1","username":"diaa-ahmedien","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":314265,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Dr. Diaa Ahmed Mohamed Ahmedien","authors_list":[{"name":"Dr. Diaa Ahmed Mohamed Ahmedien","affiliation":"New Media Arts, Helwan University","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/t8fjc96.jpg","username":"diaa-ahmedien","full_name":"Diaa Ahmedien","created_by":"Diaa Ahmedien"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"2","is_research":"1","status_info":"We are still developing and optimizing this protocol","steps":[]}
