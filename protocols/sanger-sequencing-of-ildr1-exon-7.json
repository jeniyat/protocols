In order to amplify exon 7 of the <em>ILDR1<\/em> gene, we designed the following primers: ILDR1-7F: TTGATGTCCTGATTCTGAGG and ILDR1-7R: CTCTGTGGTGGAATGAGAGG. The amplified products were then purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up system (Promega, USA) and were consequently sequenced using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The resulting sequencing reactions were then purified and precipitated using Ethanol\/EDTA\/Sodium acetate precipitation method. Capillary sequencing was performed in a Genetic Analyzer 3500 (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and the data were \u00a0analyzed using Sequencing Analysis software. The sequences were aligned with the published sequence of the <em>ILDR1<\/em> gene (NM_001199799.1).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7445","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1503329877","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Applied Biology, College of Sciences, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jhvcj66","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x22384x2v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/009.png","full_name":"Abdelaziz Tlili","created_by":"Abdelaziz Tlili","private_link":"2A68A2AA06FE35C878AF71B4F549905A","original_img":"1","username":"abdelaziz-tlili","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0185281","manuscript_citation":"Tlili A,  Mutery AFA,  Mahfood M,  Mohamed WKEA,  Bajou K (2017) Identification of a novel frameshift mutation in the <i>ILDR1<\/i> gene in a UAE family, mutations review and phenotype genotype correlation.
