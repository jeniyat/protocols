The purpose of QWB is to monitor changes in the relative abundance or modification of a target protein within a group of samples. Does the experimental treatment cause an increase or decrease in target abundance, compared to the untreated or control condition?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Replicate samples confirm the validity of observed changes in protein levels. Without replication, it is impossible to know if an effect is real or simply an artifact of experimental noise or variation. Biological and technical replicates are both important, but each type of replicate addresses different questions [1,2,3].<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Types of Replicate Measurements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Technical replicates<\/strong> are repeated measurements used to establish the variability of a protocol orassay, and determine if an experimental effect is large enough to be reliably distinguished from the assay noise [1].<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>- Examples may include loading of multiple lanes with each sample on the same blot, running<\/p>\n<p>multiple blots in parallel, or repeating the blot with the same samples on different days.<\/p>\n<p>- Technical replicates evaluate the precision and reproducibility of an assay, to determine if the<\/p>\n<p>observed effect can be reliably measured. When technical replicates are highly variable, it is<\/p>\n<p>more difficult to separate the observed effect from the assay variation. You may need to identify<\/p>\n<p>and reduce sources of error in your protocol to increase the precision of your assay. Technical<\/p>\n<p>replicates do not address the biological relevance of the results.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biological replicates<\/strong> are parallel measurements of biologically distinct and independently generated samples, used to control for biological variation and determine if the experimental effect is biologically relevant. The effect should be reproducibly observed in independent biological samples. Demonstration of a similar effect in another biological context or system can provide further confirmation.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>- Examples include analysis of samples from multiple mice rather than a single mouse, or from<\/p>\n<p>multiple batches of independently cultured and treated cells.<\/p>\n<p>- To demonstrate the same effect in a different experimental context, the experiment might be<\/p>\n<p>repeated in multiple cell lines, in related cell types or tissues, or with other biological systems.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>An appropriate replication strategy should be developed for each experimental context.
