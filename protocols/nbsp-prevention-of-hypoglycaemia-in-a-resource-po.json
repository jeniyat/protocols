Ideally, the mother can provide breast milk as soon as possible; however, in many circumstances (poor nutrition of mother, post-operative Caesarian section, etc) this may not be the case for hours or even days. If resources are available, this can be managed by providing the LBW neonate with artificial milk\/donor whilst waiting for breast milk when required. However, this is often not available in resource poor countries due to expense and difficulty in production (timely clean safe water, training in how to make the milk etc). Furthermore, in resourced hospitals, glucose is monitored in at risk babies, and should they develop hypoglycemia, IV 10% dextrose can be relatively simply administered. In resource poor settings, this is challenging- firstly, glucose monitoring and then the administration of IV 10% dextrose require resources, skills and nursing that are often not available. The primary aim of this study is to assess whether the use of oral 10% dextrose, is tolerable and reduces the incidence of hypoglycaemia in LBW newborns in the absence of sufficient maternal breast milk. 10% dextrose is readily available, inexpensive and can be stored at room temperature.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Objectives\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our aim was to assess whether hypoglycaemia could be prevented in LBW babies with insufficient maternal breast milk (MBM), by supplementing their feed with oral 10% dextrose.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a 8 months, interventional, prospective, single centre, randomised, double arm control trial on 74 newborns conducted at a district hospital in Tanzania (Tosamaganga Hospital) where Doctors with Africa - CUAMM has ongoing projects on maternal-neonatal health. LBW newborns fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to either the intervention (supplemental oral 10% dextrose) or monitoring arm. Glucose will be monitored regularly in both arms and the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes recorded together with normal vital signs. A budget of 16,000,000Tsh has been proposed for the study.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The primary outcome will be hypoglycemia (&lt;2\u00b76mmol\/L) in the first three days of life.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"12587","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1527593595","protocol_affiliation":"CUAMM, Doctors with Africa,","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.qijducn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y20394v2v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/003.png","full_name":"dominik metz","created_by":"dominik metz","private_link":"3E5FE832508C47CAECA50B1491ED0350","original_img":"1","username":"dominik-metz","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":317992,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"neonatal hypoglycaemia, 10% dextrose, low birth weight","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":1,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"dominik metz,Sara Chiurchi\u00f9,Emanuele Bottosso,Giuseppe Pontrelli,Martina Mazzocco,Lucilla Rav\u00e0","authors_list":[{"name":"dominik metz","affiliation":"CUAMM, Doctors with Africa","username":"dominik-metz","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/003.png"},{"name":"Sara Chiurchi\u00f9","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Emanuele Bottosso","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Giuseppe Pontrelli","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Martina Mazzocco","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Lucilla Rav\u00e0","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/003.png","username":"dominik-metz","full_name":"dominik metz","created_by":"dominik metz"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"632227","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"204A28DE7F004293983865044BD4D402","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1527594119","components":[{"component_id":"1117469","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"01E9EB96094843A68206E80BF258DE64","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1117468","previous_id":"1117469","original_id":"0","guid":"C24D4DC2290644BC919472462DD69B8B","previous_guid":"01E9EB96094843A68206E80BF258DE64","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Neonates in the first day of life satisfying the following inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in the study:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1.
