To achieve this, 25 heartily participants (no significant thoracic pain in the past year) and 25 participants with chronic thoracic pain will participate in 2 experimental sessions separated by 24 to 48 hours. These sessions will occur at the Neuromecanic and Motor Control Laboratory of the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada). During these sessions, spinal stiffness will be measured at four thoracic spinal levels (T5 to T8) in a randomized sequence via a mechanical device using a servo-linear motor. The device indenter (metallic cylindrical cover with a rubber of 2 cm diameter) will gradually apply 45 N to the spinous process. The muscle activity and displacement data will be recorded during the procedures. <\/div><\/div>"}
