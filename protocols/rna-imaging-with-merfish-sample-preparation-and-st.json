To fix the fiducial beads in place and to prevent subtle changes in the shape of the cell induced by the repeated washing that will occur in the MERFISH Imaging protocol, we perform an additional fixation of the samples. Aspirate the bead solution and add 3 mL of fixation buffer prewarmed to room temperature to each petri dish.\u00a0<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1037344","previous_id":"1037340","original_id":"0","guid":"5545FD9E14044558B716610FFD26C6BC","previous_guid":"A5E346DE2D3249119C07712D1AF36464","component_type_id":"3","data_id":"3958","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Amount","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"3","source_data":{"amount":"3","unit_id":"2","title":"Fixation buffer"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"600861","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"68782257BD944EC28ACCE8064178E509","previous_guid":"7C30FA5AEE3B454CBF7CD7802DAA1B02","previous_id":"600860","last_modified":"1514459309","components":[{"component_id":"1037343","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"B5012C57EE124E0AA8BCDC6DC151CC87","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Hybridization of Encoding Probes ","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Hybridization of Encoding Probes "},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1037342","previous_id":"1037343","original_id":"0","guid":"B4A5AB07534341279B9E46EB7EE4453C","previous_guid":"B5012C57EE124E0AA8BCDC6DC151CC87","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Gently rock the sample at room temperature for 10 minutes.\u00a0<\/p>","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Gently rock the sample at room temperature for 10 minutes.\u00a0<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1037347","previous_id":"1037342","original_id":"0","guid":"9AE403107F5744789A0AFAC898B32364","previous_guid":"B4A5AB07534341279B9E46EB7EE4453C","component_type_id":"4","data_id":"12165","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Duration \/ Timer","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"4","source_data":{"duration":"600","title":"Gently rocking at RT"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"600862","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"308F1C7CFA884491BA6A5810D2DE45B4","previous_guid":"68782257BD944EC28ACCE8064178E509","previous_id":"600861","last_modified":"1514468183","components":[{"component_id":"1037346","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"1C28E61C1EB44037BFDD7A4835537C9B","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Hybridization of Encoding Probes ","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Hybridization of Encoding Probes "},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1037345","previous_id":"1037346","original_id":"0","guid":"4A3A4F19AC2247AE886B05DF7C8AFE9C","previous_guid":"1C28E61C1EB44037BFDD7A4835537C9B","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Aspirate the fixation buffer, and wash the sample three times with 2X SSC.\u00a0<\/p>","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Aspirate the fixation buffer, and wash the sample three times with 2X SSC.\u00a0<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1037348","previous_id":"1037345","original_id":"0","guid":"9F43C4173E76433E9666F02437213FE3","previous_guid":"4A3A4F19AC2247AE886B05DF7C8AFE9C","component_type_id":"26","data_id":"17054","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Note","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"26","source_data":{"annotation_id":"17054","thread_id":"17054","id":"17054","thread_title":"Comment on step 23 of RNA Imaging with MERFISH - Sample Preparation and Staining","uri":"comment-on-step-23-of-rna-imaging-with-merfish-sample","thread_uri":"comment-on-step-23-of-rna-imaging-with-merfish-sample","step_id":"600862","protocol_uri":"rna-imaging-with-merfish-sample-preparation-and-st-merc3d6","protocol_name":"RNA Imaging with MERFISH - Sample Preparation and Staining","protocol_name_html":"RNA Imaging with MERFISH - Sample Preparation and Staining","annotation":"<p>If the sample was prepared in an RNase-free environment, it can now be stored in 2XSSC at 4\u00b0C for several days.
