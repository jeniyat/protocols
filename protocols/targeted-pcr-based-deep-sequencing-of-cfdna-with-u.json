The library construction was done using the QIAGEN QIAseq Targeted DNA Panel protocol, which is separated in four steps all performed on ice.  For end-repair and a-addition, 20 \u00b5l of the template cfDNA was mixed with 3.13 \u00b5l of 10x QIAGEN Fragmentation Buffer, 0.94 \u00b5l QIAGEN FERA Solution, 6.25 \u00b5l 5x Fragmentation Enzyme Mix and 1.6 \u00b5l QIAGEN FG Solution, which inhibits the fragmentation enzyme but has no effect on the end-repair and a-addition reaction. The reaction mix was incubated for 14 min at 32\u00b0C and 30 min at 72\u00b0C. The incubated reaction mix was transferred in an adapter ligation master mix, which contained 12.75 \u00b5l 5x QIAGEN Ligation Buffer, 6.4 \u00b5l QIAGEN DNA Ligase, 9.2 \u00b5l QIAGEN Ligation Solution and added 0.64 \u00b5l QIAGEN IL-N7## UMI adapter per reaction (same IL-N7## adapter for eight samples) [1,2]. Since building of a consensus sequence of amplified fragments with the same UMI, added in this step of the library preparation, excludes PCR artefacts. The mix was incubated in a thermocycler for 15 min at 20\u00b0C without heated lid. After the adapter ligation, a two stepped magnetic bead cleanup was performed, using 136.3 \u00b5l (1.4x) QIAGEN QIAseq Beads and 36.5 \u00b5l RNase-free water for the first cleanup step, washed twice with 80% ethanol and dried the beads for 10 min, before cfDNA was eluted in 52 \u00b5l RNase-free water. For the second clean up, 70 \u00b5l of the mentioned magnetic beads were used, washed twice, dried and cfDNA was eluted in 12 \u00b5l RNase-free water. Afterwards, targeted enrichment of the cfDNA library was performed by transferring the eluted library to a targeted enrichment PCR master mix, which contained 4 \u00b5l 5x QIAGEN TEPCR Buffer, 0.8 \u00b5l QIAGEN IL-Forward primer, 0.8 \u00b5l HotStarTaq Polymerase and 5 \u00b5l customized QIAGEN QIAseq Targeted DNA Panel primer. The customized panel was designed to amplify all coding regions of the following genes: AKT1, AR, BRCA1, BRCA2, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERCC4, ESR1, KRAS, FGFR1, MUC16, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, PTGFR, TGFB1 and showed high specificity and uniformity (Supplementary Table S3). The reaction mix was incubated with following conditions: 13 min at 95\u00b0C, 2 min at 98\u00b0C, 8 cycles of 15 seconds at 98\u00b0C and 10 min at 68\u00b0C, 5 min at 72\u00b0C and 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cycling was followed by a magnetic bead cleanup with 108 \u00b5l (1.2x) QIAGEN QIAseq beads and 70 \u00b5l RNase-free water, using 16 \u00b5l RNase-free water for the elution of the library. The last step of the library preparation is the universal PCR amplification, in which the cfDNA library was added to a master mix, which contained 4 \u00b5l 5x QIAGEN UPCR Buffer, 1 \u00b5l HotStartTaq Polymerase and 1.6 \u00b5l RNase-free water and each reaction mix with the same IL-7## adapter was pipetted into separate wells of an IL-5## adapter plate to add sample specific tags [2]. The following conditions for the cycling were used: 13 min at 95\u00b0C, 2 min at 98\u00b0C, 20 cycles of 15 seconds at 98\u00b0C and 2 min of 60\u00b0C, 5 min at 72\u00b0C and 5 min at 4\u00b0C. At the end, a magnetic bead cleanup with 108 \u00b5l (1.2x) QIAGEN QIAseq beads and 70 \u00b5l RNase-free water was performed.

All samples with less than 5 million read fragments were excluded, given that a low read amount is often caused by bad library quality. In a statistical point of view, the comparability of data from a sample with a low and a sample with a high read fragment output are statistically insufficient [3,4]. Furthermore all samples with an UMI coverage lower than 400 were excluded, to ensure that the read fragments were as diverse as possible for a statistical powerful statement [1]. To guarantee a balanced distribution of the reads on all target regions, samples were excluded, if less than 95% of the target region was covered with at least 5% of the mean UMI coverage.The QIAGEN Biomedical Genomics Workbench was used to build alignments of mapped reads to the targeted regions (reference genome hg19), for the analysis of the UMIs and for first variant calling [1]. The Ingenuity Variant Analysis (IVA; QIAGEN) was used for the quality scoring, detailed variant calling with customized filter (described below) and data interpretation. The IVA used five different filters for exclusion of called variants. The confidence filter excluded all variants with a call quality below 20. Variants with a prevalence of >3% in the normal population (reference data bases: 1. Allel Frequency Community (gnomAD&CGI), 2. 1000 Genomes Project, 3. ExAC and 4. NHLBI ESP exomes) were excluded, unless the variant was already known to be a pathogenic common variant, to identity rare variants potentially associated with the evaluated condition of the tested cohort (common variant filter). The filter also only kept variants that were associated with gain of function or which inheritance pattern (homozygous, compound heterozygous, haplosufficient, hemizygous, het-ambiguous or heterozygous) occurred in at least 50% of all cases at gene level (genetic analysis filter). Only variants located no more than 20 bases into intron were included (part of the predicted deleterious filter). The cancer driver variant filter kept only variants that were found in 1.) Cancer-associated mouse knockout phenotypes, 2.) cancer-associated cellular processes with any directionality 3.) cancer-associated pathways with any directionality 4.) cancer therapeutic targets 5.) published cancer literature variant and gene level findings 6.) Known or predicted cancer subnetwork regulatory sites 7.) COSMIC at a frequency greater than or equal to 0.01% 8.) TCGA at a frequency greater than or equal to 0.01%. Moreover, the IVA classified the variants according to their clinical significance (by predicted or observed evidence) into five groups: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign and benign (as defined by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; part of the predicted deleterious filter) [5].<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":666105,"guid":"092AD210BCD411E890F69DC3EDA3C78D","previous_id":666104,"previous_guid":"092A35D0BCD411E890F69DC3EDA3C78D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7159B0EB91A44783985A03592C8F57FE","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"References"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"E41F3E2776B64B28AB85D76D815882DA","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">[1]\tXu C, Nezami Ranjbar MR, Wu Z, DiCarlo J, Wang Y.
