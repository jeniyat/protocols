References of each article were reviewed. We only included randomized controlled clinical trials. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. The outcome measure was set on the incidence of the bacteremia measure within the first ten minutes post-extraction. Two reviewers independently undertook the risk of bias assessment and data extraction. A fixed-effect inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was conducted.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"10173","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1518337246","protocol_affiliation":"University of the Basque Country (UPV\/EHU) Bizkaia, Spain, BioCruces Health Research Institute, Bizkaia, Spain","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.m65c9g6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2y2a423t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/003.png","full_name":"Iciar Arteagoitia","created_by":"Iciar Arteagoitia","private_link":"15EA2F6F76F93D38CD016FFBDBD828D9","original_img":"1","username":"iciar-arteagoitia","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0195592","manuscript_citation":"Arteagoitia I,  Andr\u00e9s CR,  Ramos E (2018) Does chlorhexidine reduce bacteremia following tooth extraction?
