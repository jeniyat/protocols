A 10 Hz high pass filter cutoff is used to remove motion artifact and some other low frequency activity from the vagal recording channels.  The EMG electrode channel is given a 0.1 Hz high pass filter cutoff.  All other parameters and settings are similar to those described in Ward et al., 2015.  The outputs of the AM Systems amplifier are fed into an NI USB-6363 data acquisition system (National Instruments, Inc.), which is connected a Windows 7 laptop running Matlab R2015a and the ANC software. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":600},{"id":738390,"guid":"2AE7DA506E6911E99733115DCC18A487","previous_id":738389,"previous_guid":"35FEDCA06E6811E99733115DCC18A487","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"02C9F08C540C405A921AE77B7C851816","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"C.
