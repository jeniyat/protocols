After perfusion, the distal esophagus and the proximal duodenum were transected, and the stomach was freed and removed. The organ was then opened with a longitudinal cut along the greater curvature. Next, the ventral and dorsal stomach walls were separated by an incision along the lesser curvature, thus yielding two whole mounts per animal. <\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"76639BC0701E11E9AD776984A3CE0080","order_id":2,"type_id":20,"title":"reagents","source":{"id":159668,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Ketamine","linfor":"","url":"https:\/\/www.pattersonvet.com\/ProductItem\/078036637","sku":"07-803-6637","cas_number":"","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Patterson Veterinary","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.pattersonvet.com\/","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.iohttps:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.iohttps:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":470},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"7D807090701E11E9AD776984A3CE0080","order_id":3,"type_id":20,"title":"reagents","source":{"id":193073,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Xylazine","linfor":"","url":"http:\/\/www.akorn.com\/prod_detail_veterinary.php?ndc=59399-110-20","sku":"NDC: 59399-110-20","cas_number":"","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Akorn Animal Health","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"link":null,"image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.iohttps:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.iohttps:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":686},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":738621,"guid":"DB198D20702011E9AD776984A3CE0080","previous_id":738619,"previous_guid":"5AD4DC20701E11E9AD776984A3CE0080","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7A34E258D5D64D739178C183AF5A7C0C","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Electrode location measurement"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"8F25BE0A274A4D039877DCC5DBD56664","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The ventral half stomach was placed in PBS in a dissecting dish under a stereomicroscope, with the inner surface facing up, and the locations of two plates on each the electrodes were clearly marked with pins, and a photograph of the stomach capturing the entire surface was then taken.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The image of the stomach at a consistent magnification for each stomach to be measured was printed, and x and y locations of the midpoint of the electrode measured from the image, together with the size of the stomach itself so that electrode location could be reported as percentage measurements relative to the pylorus end of the stomach contour (x) and relative to the bottom edge of the stomach at the greater curvature (y).

Data analysis typically used two subsets of that entire recording: (1) 15 min immediately prior to stimulation; and (2) the 15 min immediately following the onset of stimulation (5 min during stimulation together with another 10 min of recording). The raw strain gauge data was filtered and rectified using lab-written MATLAB code. The same code provided three quantitative assessments of the ratio of motility during and after stimulation to motility before stimulation. These three assessments are: (1) average amplitude ratio; (2) average frequency ratio (defined as number of excursions exceeding 10% of maximum, per unit time); and (3) motility index (MI) defined as the ratio of the area under the curve during and after stimulation to the area under the curve before stimulation, per unit time.

Signals recorded from strain gauges attached to the proximal duodenal surface were used to measure the effect of stimulation by patch electrodes implanted at multiple sites across the rat stomach in an acute anesthetized preparation.  The effect of stimulation was quantified as the ratio of various motility assessments during and after stimulation vs. before stimulation, and the data was used to create a functional map of duodenal motor response to localized gastric stimulation.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1578492487}
