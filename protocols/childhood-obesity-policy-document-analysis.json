The primary objective of this study is to test the idea that the news media have an important role in connecting policymakers to policy-relevant research evidence. Specifically, this project explores three research questions:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.\tWhat factors influence policymakers\u2019 acquisition, adoption, and use of research evidence in news reports?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2.\tIn what ways, direct and indirect, does the inclusion and representation of policy-relevant research evidence in news reports facilitate the use of research evidence by policymakers?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3.\tWhat, if any, is the relative contribution of policy-relevant research evidence in news media to policymakers\u2019 use of research evidence in policymaking processes?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">To answer these questions, this study will track federal policymakers\u2019 (i.e., legislators in Congress and government bureaucrats) use of research evidence by collecting, coding, and analyzing a comprehensive set of publically available policy documents (e.g., transcripts of congressional bills, committees\/sub-committees hearings, testimonials, floor debates, government-issued memos and reports, transcripts of public speeches or comments) on the topic of childhood obesity, focusing on the scope, type, context, and timing of policymakers\u2019 use of research evidence relative to the progression of the legislative process (see Appendix A) for each of four key federal policies from 2000-2014:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.\tSchool nutrition;<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2.\tSchool physical education and activity standards;<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3.\tConsumption of sugary snacks and drinks; and<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4.\tAdvertising and marketing food to children.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1553477644}
