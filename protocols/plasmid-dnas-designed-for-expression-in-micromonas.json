For protein expression we used the promotor and 3' end elements from the endogenous RPS9 gene, and codon optimized the coding region. \u00a0For expression of guide RNAs we used the Micromonas U6 snRNA promoter. \u00a0DNA is available by contacting M. Ares &lt;ares@ucsc.edu&gt;.<\/p>\n<div class=\"\">We have constructed and sequence verified 9 plasmids which we would like to make available to others attempting to detect transformation of DNA into Micromonas. Using the CCMP1545\u00a0genome as a source for the U6 promoter sequence, and for the promoter and 3' UTR sequences of ribosomal protein RPS9, we built the following plasmids:<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\u00a0<\/div>\n<div class=\"\"><strong>CRISPR\/Cas9 plasmids for Micromonas<\/strong><\/div>\n<div class=\"\">1.

BaeI is a type IIS restriction enzyme that leaves noncompatible sticky ends. In the context of the gRNA cassette, a pair of 24 nt oligos designed to have the sticky ends compatible with BaeI cleaved plasmid are annealed and cloned into the plasmid, replacing the BaeI cassette while adding the 20 nt target complementary sequence of the desired guide RNA.<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\u00a0<\/div>\n<div class=\"\"><strong>Selectable\/Detectable Marker genes<\/strong><\/div>\n<div class=\"\">4.
