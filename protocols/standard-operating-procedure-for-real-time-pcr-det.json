The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria including culture, multi-target polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anti-pertussis toxin IgG (IgG-PT) serology, and the use of a clinical case definition.\u00a0 An additional objective was to describe the optimal timing of specimen collection for the various tests.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Clinical specimens were collected from patients with cough illness at seven locations across the United States between 2007 and 2011. Nasopharyngeal and blood specimens were collected from each patient during the enrollment visit.\u00a0 Patients who had been coughing for \u2264 2 weeks were asked to return in 2-4 weeks for collection of a second, convalescent blood specimen.\u00a0 Sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test were estimated using three methods\u2014pertussis culture as the \u201cgold standard,\u201d composite reference standard analysis (CRS), and latent class analysis (LCA).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Overall, 868 patients were enrolled and 13.6% were\u00a0<em>B. pertussis<\/em>\u00a0positive by at least one diagnostic test. \u00a0In a sample of 545 participants with non-missing data on all four diagnostic criteria, culture was 64.0% sensitive, PCR was 90.6% sensitive, and both were 100% specific by LCA.\u00a0 CRS and LCA methods increased the sensitivity estimates for convalescent serology and the clinical case definition over the culture-based estimates.\u00a0 Culture and PCR were most sensitive when performed during the first two weeks of cough; serology was optimally sensitive after the second week of cough.<\/p>\n<p>Timing of specimen collection in relation to onset of illness should be considered when ordering diagnostic tests for pertussis. Consideration should be given to including IgG-PT serology as a confirmatory test in the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition for pertussis.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<ul>\n<li><strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong> Names of vendors or manufacturers are provided as examples of suitable product sources; inclusion does not imply endorsement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Department of Health and Human Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Reagents: <strong>\u00a0<\/strong>(1) IS<em>481<\/em> primer\/probe set; (2) pIS<em>1001<\/em> primer\/probe set; (3) hIS<em>1001<\/em> primer\/probe set; (4<em>) ptxS1<\/em> primer\/probe set; (5) <em>RNaseP<\/em> primer\/probe set; (6) PerfeCTa\u00ae qPCR ToughMix, UNG for IS<em>481<\/em>, <em>ptxS1<\/em> and <em>RNaseP<\/em>; Quanta Biosciences catalog number 95138-250 for 250 reactions (Storage 2-8<sup>\u25e6<\/sup>C for up to 6 months or 20<sup>\u25e6<\/sup>C for two years); (7) PCR grade water; (8) <em>B. pertussis<\/em> positive control DNA (for <em>ptxS1<\/em> assay; CDC isolate A639; for IS<em>481<\/em>\/pIS<em>1001<\/em>\/hIS<em>1001<\/em> assay ACF which consists of a mixture of A639 <em>B. pertussis<\/em>, F585 for <em>B. parapertussis<\/em> and C690 for <em>B. holmesii<\/em>); and, (9) Human genomic positive control DNA (for <em>RNaseP<\/em> assay; Applied Biosystems; catalog number 4312660; 10ng\/\u03bcl).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Equipment\/Materials: Microcentrifuge; Pipettes; AB7500 regular and software (Applied Biosystems); Eppendorf centrifuge 5810 or similar instrument to centrifuge; Plates 96-well (Applied Biosystems; catalog #N801-0560); Optical caps (Applied Biosystems; catalog #4323032); Aerosol barrier pipette tips; Sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes to prepare master mixes; Pressure sensitive film-not optical film-Falcon; catalog number 353073; Aluminum foil; Bleach; Ethanol; DNA Away<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Quality Control: (1) When testing clinical specimen DNA, include the <em>RNaseP<\/em> set to serve as an internal positive control for the assay. A poor <em>RNaseP<\/em> signal may indicate inhibition, low DNA yield from the DNA extraction process, or poor specimen collection. (2) Extracts from sterile swabs or sterile water (blanks) should be tested to ensure there was no cross-contamination during the DNA extraction. (3) A non-template control (NTC) using sterile water in the place of DNA should be included in each assay to ensure there was no cross-contamination during PCR set-up. This NTC also serves as a negative control. (4) DNA extracted from <em>B. pertussis<\/em> strain CDC A639 at low concentration should be included as a positive control for the <em>ptxS1<\/em> assay. DNA extracted from <em>B. pertussis<\/em> strain CDC A639, from <em>B. parapertussis<\/em> strain F585 and from <em>B. holmesii<\/em> strain C690 (ACF) are combined based on the genomic equivalent of the particular species and are included as a positive control at low concentrations for IS<em>481<\/em>\/pIS<em>1001<\/em>\/hIS<em>1001<\/em> assay. The combined positive control is called ACF.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Out-of-control results: For all three assays: (1) Positive reaction of blanks indicates that contamination occurred during the DNA extraction process and specimens must be re-extracted for confirmation. Any positive specimens that were extracted at the same time as a positive blank should be regarded with suspicion. Additional epidemiological evidence is required before regarding these specimens as true positives. (2) Positive reaction of NTC \u2013 This indicates that there was contamination during the PCR set-up. The assay must be repeated. For the IS<em>481<\/em>\/pIS<em>1001<\/em>\/hIS<em>1001<\/em> and <em>ptxS1<\/em> assays: (3) Negative reaction of positive control indicates either that the PCR did not work or that the positive control is no longer usable. Repeat the assay using a fresh positive control extract before reporting results. If there is still a problem, test extracts again with a new prepared primer\/probe set. For the <em>RNaseP <\/em>assay: (4) Negative or late cycle positive <em>RNaseP<\/em> in undiluted DNA extracts indicates that either the specimen extraction contains inhibitors to the PCR assay or that the specimen was not collected correctly. To determine if inhibitors are present, check the DNA extracts at 1:5 dilution. If the <em>RNaseP<\/em> results improve with the diluted extracts, the IS<em>481<\/em>\/pIS<em>1001<\/em>\/hIS<em>1001<\/em> and <em>ptxS1<\/em> assays must be repeated using the diluted extracts. If the <em>RNaseP<\/em> results do not improve, this may indicate that the NP aspirate or swab was not collected or stored as recommended.<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8855","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1511140987","protocol_affiliation":"IHRC Inc., contracting agency to the Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kvxcw7n","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2v2a403v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Lucia Pawloski","created_by":"Lucia Pawloski","private_link":"BA272F55BF6E6D5B25EFD4C4FD8225FB","original_img":"1","username":"lucia-pawloski","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0195979","manuscript_citation":"Lee AD,  Cassiday PK,  Pawloski LC,  Tatti KM,  Martin MD,  Briere EC,  Tondella ML,  Martin SW,   obotCVSG (2018) Clinical evaluation and validation of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of <i>Bordetella pertussis<\/i> infection: Culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-pertussis toxin IgG serology (IgG-PT).
