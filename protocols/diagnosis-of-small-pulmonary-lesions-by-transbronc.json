The pooled diagnostic yield was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69-80) using the BR approach and 93% (95% CI, 90-96) using the PC approach. For PLs \u2264 2 cm, the PC approach was superior to the BR approach. However, for PLs &gt; 2 cm but \u2264 3 cm, the diagnostic yield using the BR approach was increased to 81% (95% CI, 75-85).
