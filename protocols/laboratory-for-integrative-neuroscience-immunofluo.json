This protocol can be adapted for most primary antibodies but specific antibodies and concentrations need to be determined by the user and the protocol adapted accordingly. Secondary antibodies listed are optimal for the Axiozoom and LSM880 filters and excitation sources and may need to be changed to match the microscope available. I also provide tips for optimizing staining, reducing background, and characterizing antibodies.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<ul>\n<li><span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">If unfamiliar with fluorescence microscopy, see tutorial:\u00a0 https:\/\/micro.magnet.fsu.edu\/primer\/techniques\/fluorescence\/fluorhome.html<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Before starting, validate and titrate all antibodies.

The titration should result in a signal that is dependent on the concentration of the primary antibody such that a change in concentration result in a change in exposure time when imaging (i.e. 1:1000 is a 1 second exposure, while 1:2000 requires 2 seconds of exposure.
