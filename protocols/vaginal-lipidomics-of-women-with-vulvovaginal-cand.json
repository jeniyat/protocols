Data normalization, scaling, hierarchical clustering into heatmaps and multivariate statistical analysis were performed in the MetaboAnalyst 3.0 platform.\u00a0Metabolites with a value of p &lt; 0.05 (ANOVA) were considered representative for further investigation. Exploratory multivariate data analysis was performed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) unsupervised method and the Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), allowing selection of molecules with a VIP index higher than 1.0 as potential biomarkers. Putative lipid identification of the selected biomarkers was performed by measurement of their exact mass, retention time and elution profile, and further matching of such compounds in METLIN, Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)\u00a0and Lipid Maps databases<span style=\"font-size: 10.8333px;\">.<\/span><\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"644673","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"8AF94254FBEE446D922D349BF97DE94C","previous_guid":"D47816C8EDAF48628BD2E85C188C0C23","previous_id":"644672","last_modified":"1531757468","components":[{"component_id":"1149423","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"E356F0D5E4004E9DAA4C79A66997BDF0","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1149424","previous_id":"1149423","original_id":"0","guid":"B6D3B5E592914E0C8396252B5E26B3C4","previous_guid":"E356F0D5E4004E9DAA4C79A66997BDF0","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data processing ","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data processing "},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"644674","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"7BF42D0EBA404DA080A8D9C55E134B5E","previous_guid":"8AF94254FBEE446D922D349BF97DE94C","previous_id":"644673","last_modified":"1531757474","components":[{"component_id":"1149425","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"B129394E9FA149CDA9D9E500FB98B87A","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1149426","previous_id":"1149425","original_id":"0","guid":"BBE7DEFC049F4026A85DD882FE6C8190","previous_guid":"B129394E9FA149CDA9D9E500FB98B87A","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data processing ","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data processing "},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"644675","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"C1A370B79B3741C68978CA2F18EFA264","previous_guid":"7BF42D0EBA404DA080A8D9C55E134B5E","previous_id":"644674","last_modified":"1531757477","components":[{"component_id":"1149427","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"E67AC72CC06F402D8FB0F2DCBEC50854","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1149428","previous_id":"1149427","original_id":"0","guid":"BADF80B54D6646B3BFC8BFA2E5C2175A","previous_guid":"E67AC72CC06F402D8FB0F2DCBEC50854","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data processing ","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data processing "},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"644676","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"4389CE404D1A4F5CAADDE8F8957C9F04","previous_guid":"C1A370B79B3741C68978CA2F18EFA264","previous_id":"644675","last_modified":"1531757479","components":[{"component_id":"1149429","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"C8CDEDBDAD4345819F7E5198735A2D1F","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1149430","previous_id":"1149429","original_id":"0","guid":"8A604B1318E1432B958DA8D64C319A9E","previous_guid":"C8CDEDBDAD4345819F7E5198735A2D1F","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data processing ","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data processing "},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"644677","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"F48E0CC7B25140B087D68444BFE23A3E","previous_guid":"4389CE404D1A4F5CAADDE8F8957C9F04","previous_id":"644676","last_modified":"1531757483","components":[{"component_id":"1149431","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"6B7F711B8B6B47A18BC8A1B800C85211","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1149432","previous_id":"1149431","original_id":"0","guid":"07F3F8E4B1634F959E80A8C2AACB08CB","previous_guid":"6B7F711B8B6B47A18BC8A1B800C85211","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data processing ","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data processing "},"is_project":0}]}]}
