However, due to the absence of uniform evaluation standards, most medical institutions rely on the reference values provided by the manufacturer of the testing detectors. And different detectors have different recommended values.Therefore, our study aimed to compare the ATP bioluminescence method with the colony counting method and the ATP bioluminescence method , also compare different ATP bioluminescence detector types, for monitoring the disinfection effect of environmental surfaces. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1567872362}
