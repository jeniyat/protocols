The collaboration boasts a biobank, which includes more than 50,000 samples from 21,886individuals from across China ever diagnosed in Beijing since 1986, and an HIV epidemiology database, which tracks everyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV infection in Beijing and records a baseline CD4 cell count for all newly identified individuals. We used BD FACSCalibur, BD FACSCanto II,\u00a0and Beckman Coulter FC500 for CD4 cell counting.Each year we will conduct a survey of HIV TDR among individuals newly diagnosed with HIV. To ensure representative sampling, we designed a standardized sampling strategy. For simplicity, however, we just randomly selected half of the samples from all newly identified individuals. In addition, we retrospectively included half of samples that were stored in the biobank before routine genotyping was introduced in Beijing. We included study participants if they were aged 18 years or older, were newly diagnosed with HIV infection, and not pregnant.

Both laboratories participated in external quality assessment schemes for genotypic DR testing from the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Center for AIDS\/STD Control and Prevention. We defined TDR in two steps. First, we estimated the prevalence of TDR with the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) method, based on the WHO list of surveillance drug-resistant mutations 2009 (SDRM 2009) update. [12]Second, for patients harboring a virus with at least one\u00a0drug-resistant\u00a0mutation, we used the Stanford drug-susceptibility algorithm (version 8.5) to classify sequences as susceptible (Stanford level 1 or 2), low-level resistance (Stanford level 3), intermediate-level resistance (Stanford level 4), or high-level resistance (Stanford level 5) to the drug classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs) and specific drugs. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We entrust three commercially available sequencing companies(Beijing Sino Geno Max Co., Ltd , Beijing Tsingke Biological technology Co., Ltd, Beijing Tianyi Huiyuan Biological technology Co., Ltd) to do the sequencing with an ABI 3500Analyzer. \u00a0All these companies participated in external quality assessment schemes for sequencing test from us.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":826504,"guid":"A5742DE0EFE311E9ACE393E7010909E0","previous_id":826503,"previous_guid":"8608A940EFE311E9ACE393E7010909E0","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"3FCFD18D4EBF45AD88FEA9F2BC2D554A","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"83833C9B9D894526A3A75D0445C1FB6E","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Analysis: We captured the baseline data from these individuals, including demographic characteristics, transmission risk group, and CD4 cell count in the Beijing HIV epidemiology database. We anonymized and de-identified the patients\u2019 information prior to analysis. We categorized those with Beijing Hukou as Beijing residents. Hukou is a basic system of household registration in China. It officially identifies a person as a resident of an area and includes identifying information such as name, parents, spouse, and date of birth. We established four sampling phases\u00a0for convenient sake:2001\u20132008, \u00a02009\u20132011, 2012\u20132014, 2015\u20132016. We compared categorical data with the \u03c7\u00b2 test and continuous data with one-way ANOVA where appropriate. We calculated the prevalence of sequences containing at least one drug-resistant mutation and further specified for transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs\u00a0(NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). We analyzed the potential risk factors for acquiring any drug-resistant mutations by using logistic regression. We assessed biologically plausible interactions in the multivariable model. Variables investigated were sex, age (18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and \u226565 years), ethnicity, HIV subtype, CD4 cell count (<200, 200-349, 350-499,and \u2265500 cells per \u03bcL), transmission risk group, and sampling phase. In the model, we included a binary response, indicating detection of any drug-resistant mutation from each patient as an outcome.  We analyzed variables independently and included those that were associated (p<0.1) with the outcome in the multivariable model. We expressed our results as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and two-sided P values, with a P value of <0.05 considered statistically significant.
