Aquaria were well equipped with plants, twigs and stones.<\/p>\n<p>We fed the fish twice a day <em>ad libitum<\/em> with commercially available flake food, frozen blood worms (chironomid larvae), as well as <em>Artemia salina<\/em> nauplii and shrimps. In the stock tanks and all experimental tanks, water temperature was kept at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Water quality was maintained by exchanging half of the water every two weeks, while one tenth of the water was exchanged every day in case of the (smaller) isolation tanks. Aged tap water was used for water changes and throughout the entire experiment.<\/p>\n<p>After acclimation period, we randomly selected adult focal fish from our stock tanks and isolated them, separated by sex, in 96-l tanks 24 hours prior to behavioral tests. To avoid aggressive interactions between individuals and to enable repeated testing of the same individuals, we kept each focal fish separately in 1.5-l transparent perforated plastic bottles, which allowed water exchange with the environment.<\/p>\n<p>A web cam (KC-QB960AK, Keeper, Shenzhen, China) was fixed in a central position approximately 70 cm above the test tank during all behavioral observations, allowing us to remotely observe the focal fish from above. We introduced an air stone connected to an air pump into the test tanks between trials to guarantee well-oxygenated water, and we changed the water every day after a testing session (every 4 trials). Fish were returned to their isolation tanks between subsequent trials.<\/p>","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"10175","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1518376682","protocol_affiliation":"College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, P.R.
