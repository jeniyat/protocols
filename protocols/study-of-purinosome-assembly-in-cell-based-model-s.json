Both may be true depending on the method of observation. To clarify this point, we combined two previously used methods, transfection and immunofluorescence, to detect purinosomes in purinosome-free cells deficient in particular DNPS steps (CR-DNPS cells) and in cells deficient in the salvage pathway, which resulted in construction of the purinosome regardless of purine level (CR-HGPRT cells).<\/p>\n<p>To restore or disrupt purinosome formation, we transiently transfected CR-DNPS and CR-HGPRT cells with vectors encoding BFP-labelled wild-type (wt) proteins and observed the normalization of purinosome formation. The CR-DNPS cell line transfected with a DNA plasmid encoding an enzyme with zero activity served as a negative control for purinosome formation.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"12999","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1528880872","protocol_affiliation":"Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.qxfdxjn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"4313b423y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","full_name":"Marie Zikanova","created_by":"Marie Zikanova","private_link":"49A497FF8820A6084F12FEC41F4BC4C7","original_img":"1","username":"marie-zikanova","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0201432","manuscript_citation":"Baresova V,  Skopova V,  Souckova O,  Krijt M,  Kmoch S,  Zikanova M (2018) Study of purinosome assembly in cell-based model systems with <i>de novo<\/i> purine synthesis and salvage pathway deficiencies.
