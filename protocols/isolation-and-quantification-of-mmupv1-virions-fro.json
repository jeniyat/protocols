In our studies we have used both crude virus extracts or purified virus particles. Crude virus extract refers to virus present in supernatants obtained by clarifying papillomatous tissue extracts from nude mice. Our method of generation of crude virus extract has been modified from a previous protocol used to isolate merkel cell polyomavirus from human skin swabs(1). Purified virus particles refer to crude extract clarified over an optiprep gradient. Optiprep gradients have been used to purify papillomavirus generated in <em>vitro<\/em> (2) and have been described in detail on Dr. Chris Buck\u2019s website: <a href=\"https:\/\/home.ccr.cancer.gov\/LCO\/pseudovirusproduction.htm#_ENREF_7\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/home.ccr.cancer.gov\/LCO\/pseudovirusproduction.htm#_ENREF_7<\/a>. We measure the amount of encapsidated viral genomic DNA to determine the concentration of \"viral genome equivalents\" (VGE) in any given stock of virus. For this we use a standard agarose gel electrophoresis followed by SYBR-green staining. The same gel can also be used for southern analysis using MmuPV1-specific probes (3) by nick translation as we have described in detail previously(4). Since virus yields from papillomas of nude mice are very high, we have found agarose gel electrophoresis to be sensitive enough to accurately determine virus concentrations. Other methods of virus quantification have also been described in the literature(5, 6).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>References:<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.
