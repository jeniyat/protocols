To facilitate use, we utilize commercial kits and open source software, and standardized PCR and sequencing protocols.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Overview. <\/strong>From start to finish there are four laboratory components, each of which can potentially be completed in one day. Except for filtration, which we aim to do within 0-2 days of collection, samples can be safely stored for weeks to months between steps at -20 \u00b0C. All procedures are done on an open bench wearing gloves; wipe down work area and equipment after use with 10% bleach. We change gloves a lot to minimize cross contamination. Separate sets of pipettors and reagents are used for pre- and post-PCR work. We do one component at a time; in particular when filtering do not perform other procedures including DNA isolation and PCR. Unfiltered pipette tips are employed; after each procedure used tips are discarded and collection containers rinsed with 10% bleach. To reduce potential for cross-contamination, we do PCR in GE Illustra 8-tube strips (i.e., not 96-well plates), and other steps in individual 1.5 ml microfuge tubes.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>LABORATORY COMPONENTS<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1.
