In this paper, we demonstrate a dedicated workflow for this analysis method, specifically for Ti6Al4V powder typically used in commercial powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) systems. The methodology presented includes sample size requirements, scan conditions and settings, reconstruction and image analysis procedures. We envisage this method will support standardization in powder analysis in the additive manufacturing community. This is aimed at ultimately improving the quality of additively manufactured parts, through the identification of impurities and defects in powders.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"14424","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1533283662","protocol_affiliation":"University of Stellenbosch","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.sbyeapw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t23433t213","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","full_name":"Anton du Plessis","created_by":"Anton du Plessis","private_link":"77AFD21F84B84FB4C667A2F026454B76","original_img":"1","username":"anton-du-plessis","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>A du Plessis, I Yadroistava, SG le Roux, I Yadroitsev, 'X-ray microcomputed tomography in additive manufacturing: a review of the current technology and applications', 3D printing and additive manufacturing.\u00a0http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/3dp.2018.0060<\/p>","journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":337059,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"additive manufacturing, microCT, x-ray tomography, metal powders","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"3","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/silver.svg","badge_description":"Power author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Anton du Plessis","authors_list":[{"name":"Anton du Plessis","affiliation":"University of Stellenbosch","username":"anton-du-plessis","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","username":"anton-du-plessis","full_name":"Anton du Plessis","created_by":"Anton du Plessis"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[]}
