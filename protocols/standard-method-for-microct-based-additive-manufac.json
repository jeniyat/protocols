Besides its widespread use, few standards exist and none for additive manufacturing as yet. This is due to the inherent differences in part design, sizes and geometries, which results in different scan resolutions and qualities. This makes direct comparison between different scans of additively manufactured parts almost impossible. In addition, different image analysis methodologies can produce different results. In this method paper, we present a simplified 10 mm cube-shaped coupon sample as a standard size for detailed analysis of porosity using microCT, and a simplified workflow for obtaining porosity information. The aim is to be able to obtain directly comparable porosity information from different samples from the same AM system and even from different AM systems, and to potentially correlate detailed morphologies of the pores or voids with improper process parameters. The method is applied to two examples of different characteristic types of voids in AM: sub-surface lack of fusion due to improper contour scanning, and tree-like pores growing in the build direction. This standardized method demonstrates the capability for microCT to not only quantify porosity, but also identify void types which can be used to improve AM process optimization.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"14420","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1533323024","protocol_affiliation":"University of Stellenbosch,YXLON International GmbH,National Laser Centre, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.sc7eazn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t23433t213","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/43ffw26.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","full_name":"Anton du Plessis","created_by":"Anton du Plessis","private_link":"2DEF5BDA201D499D000F7C9185C3FFC4","original_img":"1","username":"anton-du-plessis","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>A du Plessis, I Yadroistava, SG le Roux, I Yadroitsev, 'X-ray microcomputed tomography in additive manufacturing: a review of the current technology and applications', 3D printing and additive manufacturing. <a href=\"http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/3dp.2018.0060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/3dp.2018.0060<\/a><\/p>","journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":337246,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[{"created_on":"2018-08-03 19:03:44","change_time":"2018-08-03 19:03:44","username":"anita-brllochs","full_name":"Anita Br\u00f6llochs","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/p28fw26.png","affiliation":"Protocols.io"},{"created_on":"2018-08-03 22:44:51","change_time":"2018-08-03 22:44:51","username":"anton-du-plessis","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","full_name":"Anton du Plessis","affiliation":null}],"keywords":"additive manufacturing, x-ray tomography, microCT, image analysis, porosity, quality control","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"3","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/silver.svg","badge_description":"Power author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"big_protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/43efw26.png","big_protocol_img_ofn":"screen shot 2018-08-03 at 12.07.15 pm.png","is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Anton du Plessis,Philip Sperling,Andre Beerlink,Lerato Tshabalala,Shaik Hoosain,Ntombi Mathe,Stephan G le Roux","authors_list":[{"name":"Anton du Plessis","affiliation":"University of Stellenbosch","username":"anton-du-plessis","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png"},{"name":"Philip Sperling","affiliation":"YXLON International GmbH","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Andre Beerlink","affiliation":"YXLON International GmbH","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Lerato Tshabalala","affiliation":"National Laser Centre, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Shaik Hoosain","affiliation":"National Laser Centre, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Ntombi Mathe","affiliation":"National Laser Centre, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Stephan G le Roux","affiliation":"University of Stellenbosch","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","username":"anton-du-plessis","full_name":"Anton du Plessis","created_by":"Anton du Plessis"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"<div title=\"Page 1\">\n<p><strong>Introduction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Additive manufacturing (AM) is a fast growing and reliable manufacturing method, with critical metal parts for medical and aerospace applications being produced and processing workflows qualified for the purpose, see for example [1]. Despite huge advances, there are a lack of standards especially for microCT based inspection of AM parts [2]. The microCT-based non-destructive analysis of additive manufactured parts was reviewed recently in [3]. Additive manufactured parts are typically prone to defects such as voids or porosity, which negatively affect their mechanical performance. In the ideal scenario, defects should be minimized in size and extent, which can be achieved through process parameter optimization [4]. Although inspection of the final built part non-destructively is also important, the achievable resolution of X-ray microCT is limited by part size. Typically microCT resolution scales linearly with part size, eg. 50 mm part results in 50 \u03bcm resolution, 20 mm part results in 20 \u03bcm, etc.[5] Since some types of additive manufacturing defects may be small and hence missed in a scan of a large complex part, process optimization should ideally be achieved prior to building critical parts. Such process optimization can be done using microCT of small test samples.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Due to the widespread use of microCT for porosity analysis, there are many possible scanning and analysis workflows and algorithms in use for this purpose. Depending on the scan quality (the presence of artefacts, noise, image blur, etc), the type of de-noising used and the analysis workflow used in image processing, different results can be obtained. These can also be presented in different ways which may lead to misinterpretation. Some examples of microCT-based porosity analysis of AM parts are presented in [6]\u2013[8]. The lack of standards is related to the fact that every type of part tested requires different scan parameters for best quality [9], [10]. This has created an opportunity for standardization in the testing of AM parts [2], [11] and for microCT of coupon samples. In this work a standard workflow is proposed, with high quality scan parameters, without de-noising and an image analysis workflow with minimal user influence. The coupon sample used is small enough to allow high resolution and quality scans, and besides the porosity analysis demonstrated here, average density and surface roughness can also be quantified on the same sample, as will be demonstrated in subsequent method papers [12], [13].<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 2\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>The Method<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/standard-method-for-microct-based-additive-manufac-sc7eazn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steps section<\/a> for detailed workflow.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 6\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The workflow described in this paper is not entirely independent of human error, since the threshold step requires human intervention. In order to automate the process, algorithms are available for automatically assessing the local greyvalue variations to assign pore or void spaces. However, the manual method eliminates possible errors such as in the case of powder filled voids which might be missed by automated algorithms. It is also possible that small pore spaces can be seen but not included in the analysis, due to partial volume effects. This is acceptable as the smallest pores in the segmentation are selected to be 8 voxels (2x2x2), in order to eliminate noise. In the case of such interest in further detailed analysis, sectioning and higher resolution scans or microscope-based imaging is suggested. The second in this series of papers discusses mean density determination, which can also overcome this problem to some extent, especially when large numbers of pores are smaller than the voxel size [12].<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In order to make a quantitative analysis of voids or porosity, the CT scan image quality is crucial, which is mainly determined by the scan time. We demonstrate here a simple method to measure the image quality in CT images: a 2.5 mm cube is selected inside the coupon sample 10 mm cube and provides an average grey value and a standard deviation of grey values within this cube. The ratio of grey value over standard deviation of grey values provides a signal to noise ratio for the material. Similarly, a signal to noise ratio for the background is obtained. The cubes selected is shown in <strong>Figure<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div title=\"Page 7\">\n<p><strong>5<\/strong>. The ratio of signal to noise for material over background provides an overall image quality metric that can be applied to any CT data sets. It is important to realize that any image processing will affect this result \u2013 for example applying a de-noising filter during reconstruction will reduce the variation of grey values thereby increasing the signal to noise. Therefore this criteria must be used on unprocessed data, and potentially additional image quality metrics need to be devised when comparing different systems, this is currently under investigation. Here we propose it only as a simple system for generic indication of good image quality when comparing different scans on the same system. In this case we demonstrate the metric for three types of scans in <strong>Figure 6<\/strong>, the 1 hr scan being the one used here for quantitative analysis. As the image quality reduces, the images become grainy and more noisy in material and in background, making it more difficult to accurately detect pores, and easier to make mistakes (false pore identifications).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/433fw26.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/432fw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2018-08-03 at 2.50.20 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 7\">\n<p><strong>Figure 5<\/strong>: Measuring image quality: cubic volumes selected inside and outside the part.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 7\">\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/435fw26.png\" width=\"505\" height=\"323\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/434fw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2018-08-03 at 2.51.24 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 7\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Figure 6<\/strong>: Image quality for optimized scan of 1 hr, faster scan of 25 minutes and fast scan of 1 minute.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 8\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Besides total porosity, the largest pore and pore distribution, another specification in aerospace applications is the distance between pores relative to their size. Specifically, the distance between pores must be larger than the diameter of the largest pore of the two under consideration. This can be automatically analysed using the gap distance \u2013 which provides for each pore the distance to the next nearest pore space (minimal distance between circumscribed spheres of the pore spaces). This is demonstrated on a subvolume of 7 mm in the same sample shown in <strong>Figure 1<\/strong>, this time excluding the near-surface pores. <strong>Figure 7<\/strong> shows the presence of a total of 648 pores with an average volumetric porosity of 0.023 %, and <strong>Figure 8<\/strong> shows the gap distance vs the pore diameter.
