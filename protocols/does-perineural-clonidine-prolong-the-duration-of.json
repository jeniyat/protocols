The advantages of nerve blocks are, in addition to pain relief, reduced morphine consumption and consequently less morphine-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting and sedation. Nerve blocks can be performed either as a single (bolus) or as a continuous infusion using perineural catheters. The limitation of single-shot blocks is the relatively short duration. Compared to the catheter-based solutions single-shot blocks may be associated with a lower risk of infection, are considered to be less complicated to perform and can easily be used for outpatients (1, 2).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In order to prolong the effect of single-shot blockades, attempts have been made to add various adjuvants for local anesthetics with varying success. Several studies have shown that clonidine prolongs the duration of a single-shot nerve block compared to placebo (3-20), but it is unclear whether this effect is exerted via a systemic or local mechanism (3-5, 21-23). We wish to investigate whether perineural administration of clonidine prolongs the duration of a ropivacaine nerve block, when controlling for systemic effects.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Our group has validated different methods that can be used to assess the duration of sensory block, and found that the following methods can estimate the duration with high precision: temperature discrimination test with an alcohol swab, pin-prick, warmth detection threshold, WDT, and heat pain detection threshold, HPDT, as well as pain during tonic heat stimulation of the skin (24).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Clonidines mechanism of action will be investigated using an adductor canal block (ACB). This is a peripheral nerve block which has been found to be effective in treating postoperative pain after knee alloplastic surgery, with the advantage of being an almost purely sensory block (25-27). The trial will be conducted as a randomized, blinded, paired trial in healthy volunteers. All participants will receive bilateral ACB with 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine in each thigh. According to the randomization 1.0 ml of clonidine 150 ug\/ml will be added to the local anesthetic on one side and 1.0 ml of placebo (normal saline) on the opposite side.<\/p>\n<p>There is a dose response relationship between clonidine and duration of the nerve block. Most studies with positive results have used a clonidine dose of 150 \u03bcg.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Nerve Blocks are a well-established treatment for surgery and pain relief, and a follow-up study of patients after receiving adductor channel blocks showed no signs of nerve damage 3-6 months after surgery (28). The models used in the study is validated in other medical specialties, and the discomfort experienced is normally only perceived as mild.<\/p>\n<p>A study on isolated sensory neurons from rats showed that clonidine was not associated with increased cell death when used as an adjuvant for ropivacaine (29).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the trial is to investigate if clonidine used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine prolongs the duration of a single-shot nerve block by a peripheral mechanism when controlling for systemic effects. Our hypothesis is, that the perineural injection of clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine prolongs the duration of an ACB compared to ropivacaine + placebo.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Purpose<\/h2>\n<p>The purpose of the trial is to investigate whether clonidine used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine prolongs block duration by a peripheral mechanism when controlling for systemic effects. Our hypothesis is that perineural coadministration of clonidine and ropivacaine prolongs the duration of an ACB compared with ropivacaine and placebo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Outcomes<\/h2>\n<h4>Primary outcome measure<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until an alcohol swab feels cold again (temperature discrimination).\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h6>Secondary outcome measures<\/h6>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until the stimulation with a needle again elicits a painful response (feels sharp).<\/li>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until pain during tonic heat stimulation returns to baseline values (\u00b1 10 mm on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)).<\/li>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until warmth detection threshold (WDT) returns to baseline values<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(+2<sup>o <\/sup>C or below).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until pain heat pain detection threshold (HPDT) returns to baseline values (+2<sup>o <\/sup>C or below).<\/li>\n<li>The difference in maximum pain score (VAS) during tonic heat stimulation of the skin (30 seconds at 45<sup> O<\/sup> C) between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, at 4 hours post block.<\/li>\n<li>The difference in maximum pain score (VAS) during tonic heat stimulation of the skin (30 seconds at 45<sup> O<\/sup> C) between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, at 1 hour after resolution of the block (rebound pain).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h1>Ethical considerations<\/h1>\n<h1>General considerations<\/h1>\n<p>Ropivacaine is a well-established local anesthetic registered for perineural use, and is administered within recommended doses.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Clonidine is approved for systemic use. Clonidine is not approved for perineural administration, but is well\u2013established in the literature as an adjuvant for peripheral nerve blocks. There are no existing reports of permanent nerve damage in studies employing perineural clonidine, and an in vitro study involving rats did not find increased incidence of nerve inflammation\/damage when clonidine was coadministered with ropivacaine compared to ropivacaine alone.\u00a0 It is therefore our opinion that side effects and risks associated with participation in this trial are minimal.<\/p>\n<p>The nerve blocks are performed using ultrasound guidance minimizing the risk of complications. The nerve blocks are performed by one anesthesiologists trained in ultrasound-guided nerve blocks.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The pain-induction model applied in this trial is simple, safe and reproducible.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This trial is conducted in healthy volunteers, since a paired bilateral design is necessary to control for systemic effects.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In this trial, we wish to test the hypothesis that clonidine used as an adjuvant to the ropivacaine in a peripheral nerve block extends the duration of the block by a local mechanism, compared to ropivacaine + placebo. The participants will not benefit directly from the trial, but the results of the trial may become a benefit for patients in the future. We are investigating if clonidine prolongs the duration of a nerve block by a peripheral mechanism. If no effect is seen, then ineffective treatment can be avoided in the future. A demonstrated peripheral effect can lead to a more efficient postoperative pain treatment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The trial will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. The protocol will be sent to the Regional Ethics Committee, The National Department of Health and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The principal investigator will inform the Regional Ethics Committee, The National Department of Health and the Danish Data Protection Agency in case of significant changes to the protocol. The trial will be registered at https:\/\/eudract.ema.europa.eu and https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Risks, side effects and disadvantages <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All procedures, including peripheral nerve blocks, are associated with possible complications, albeit very rarely (0.02-0.4%).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Known complications are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nerve injury (incidence 0.04%). Approximately 99\u00a0% of all nerve injuries resolves without treatment within one year.<\/li>\n<li>Used correctly, no side effects are seen associated with ropivacaine, but upon accidental intravascular injection, serious toxic side effects such as paresthesia, convulsions and circulatory collapse may occur. The risk of intravasal injection of the local anesthetic is minimal, and is reduced by the use of ultrasound and thorough aspiration prior to and after every 5 ml of local anesthetic.<\/li>\n<li>Systemic side effects of clonidine are transient and often mild. Sedation is normally not perceived as unpleasant. Hypotension (MAP &lt;55) can be treated by administering isotonic saline or ephedrine 10 mg. Bradycardia can occur, but rarely requires treatment. Significant bradycardia of HR&lt;40 can be treated with atropine 0.5 mg iv.<\/li>\n<li>A small hematoma can occur at the needle puncture site. This may cause tenderness but resolves without treatment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The nerve blocks will be performed using ultrasound guidance, which probably reduces the risk of complications.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There is a dose response relationship between clonidine and the prolongation of the nerve block. Most studies with positive results used a dose of 150 \u03bcg, and at the same time reports a minimum of side effects (30). Clonidine is used frequently daily at the hospital for the treatment of shivering on recovery wards after surgery and opioid abstinence in the ICU.

El Saied (9) investigated ropivacaine with clonidine as an adjuvant perineurally vs. ropivacaine alone in a study with 50 patients. The addition of clonidine as an adjuvant prolonged the sensory blockade 489-628 minutes (95% CI 90-187). In a yet unpublished study by our group on healthy volunteers, we found a sensory duration of an ACB with 20ml ropivacaine 5 mg\/ml of 22 (SD 4) hours. Accordingly, we find that a 240 minutes prolongation of block duration will be clinically relevant. With a type 1 error risk of 5% and a type 2 error risk of 10% and an SD of 240 minutes, a total of 18 subjects is needed in this paired trial to show a difference of 240 minutes. In order to compensate for possible dropouts, we plan to include 21 participants.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\"><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data handling<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The trial ends when 21 participants are included.<\/p>\n<p>Every participant\u2019s\u00a0assessability\u00a0in the statistical analysis will be determined before the code is broken.

The advantages of nerve blocks are, in addition to pain relief, reduced morphine consumption and consequently less morphine-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting and sedation. Nerve blocks can be performed either as a single (bolus) or as a continuous infusion using perineural catheters. The limitation of single-shot blocks is the relatively short duration. Compared to the catheter-based solutions single-shot blocks may be associated with a lower risk of infection, are considered to be less complicated to perform and can easily be used for outpatients (1, 2).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In order to prolong the effect of single-shot blockades, attempts have been made to add various adjuvants for local anesthetics with varying success. Several studies have shown that clonidine prolongs the duration of a single-shot nerve block compared to placebo (3-20), but it is unclear whether this effect is exerted via a systemic or local mechanism (3-5, 21-23). We wish to investigate whether perineural administration of clonidine prolongs the duration of a ropivacaine nerve block, when controlling for systemic effects.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Our group has validated different methods that can be used to assess the duration of sensory block, and found that the following methods can estimate the duration with high precision: temperature discrimination test with an alcohol swab, pin-prick, warmth detection threshold, WDT, and heat pain detection threshold, HPDT, as well as pain during tonic heat stimulation of the skin (24).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Clonidines mechanism of action will be investigated using an adductor canal block (ACB). This is a peripheral nerve block which has been found to be effective in treating postoperative pain after knee alloplastic surgery, with the advantage of being an almost purely sensory block (25-27). The trial will be conducted as a randomized, blinded, paired trial in healthy volunteers. All participants will receive bilateral ACB with 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine in each thigh. According to the randomization 1.0 ml of clonidine 150 ug\/ml will be added to the local anesthetic on one side and 1.0 ml of placebo (normal saline) on the opposite side.<\/p>\n<p>There is a dose response relationship between clonidine and duration of the nerve block. Most studies with positive results have used a clonidine dose of 150 \u03bcg.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Nerve Blocks are a well-established treatment for surgery and pain relief, and a follow-up study of patients after receiving adductor channel blocks showed no signs of nerve damage 3-6 months after surgery (28). The models used in the study is validated in other medical specialties, and the discomfort experienced is normally only perceived as mild.<\/p>\n<p>A study on isolated sensory neurons from rats showed that clonidine was not associated with increased cell death when used as an adjuvant for ropivacaine (29).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the trial is to investigate if clonidine used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine prolongs the duration of a single-shot nerve block by a peripheral mechanism when controlling for systemic effects. Our hypothesis is, that the perineural injection of clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine prolongs the duration of an ACB compared to ropivacaine + placebo.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Purpose<\/h2>\n<p>The purpose of the trial is to investigate whether clonidine used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine prolongs block duration by a peripheral mechanism when controlling for systemic effects. Our hypothesis is that perineural coadministration of clonidine and ropivacaine prolongs the duration of an ACB compared with ropivacaine and placebo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Outcomes<\/h2>\n<h4>Primary outcome measure<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until an alcohol swab feels cold again (temperature discrimination).\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h6>Secondary outcome measures<\/h6>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until the stimulation with a needle again elicits a painful response (feels sharp).<\/li>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until pain during tonic heat stimulation returns to baseline values (\u00b1 10 mm on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)).<\/li>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until warmth detection threshold (WDT) returns to baseline values<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(+2<sup>o <\/sup>C or below).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference in duration of sensory block between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, measured as time from block performance (removal of the needle) until pain heat pain detection threshold (HPDT) returns to baseline values (+2<sup>o <\/sup>C or below).<\/li>\n<li>The difference in maximum pain score (VAS) during tonic heat stimulation of the skin (30 seconds at 45<sup> O<\/sup> C) between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, at 4 hours post block.<\/li>\n<li>The difference in maximum pain score (VAS) during tonic heat stimulation of the skin (30 seconds at 45<sup> O<\/sup> C) between ACB with ropivacaine + clonidine versus ACB with ropivacaine + placebo, at 1 hour after resolution of the block (rebound pain).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h1>Ethical considerations<\/h1>\n<h1>General considerations<\/h1>\n<p>Ropivacaine is a well-established local anesthetic registered for perineural use, and is administered within recommended doses.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Clonidine is approved for systemic use. Clonidine is not approved for perineural administration, but is well\u2013established in the literature as an adjuvant for peripheral nerve blocks. There are no existing reports of permanent nerve damage in studies employing perineural clonidine, and an in vitro study involving rats did not find increased incidence of nerve inflammation\/damage when clonidine was coadministered with ropivacaine compared to ropivacaine alone.\u00a0 It is therefore our opinion that side effects and risks associated with participation in this trial are minimal.<\/p>\n<p>The nerve blocks are performed using ultrasound guidance minimizing the risk of complications. The nerve blocks are performed by one anesthesiologists trained in ultrasound-guided nerve blocks.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The pain-induction model applied in this trial is simple, safe and reproducible.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This trial is conducted in healthy volunteers, since a paired bilateral design is necessary to control for systemic effects.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In this trial, we wish to test the hypothesis that clonidine used as an adjuvant to the ropivacaine in a peripheral nerve block extends the duration of the block by a local mechanism, compared to ropivacaine + placebo. The participants will not benefit directly from the trial, but the results of the trial may become a benefit for patients in the future. We are investigating if clonidine prolongs the duration of a nerve block by a peripheral mechanism. If no effect is seen, then ineffective treatment can be avoided in the future. A demonstrated peripheral effect can lead to a more efficient postoperative pain treatment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The trial will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. The protocol will be sent to the Regional Ethics Committee, The National Department of Health and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The principal investigator will inform the Regional Ethics Committee, The National Department of Health and the Danish Data Protection Agency in case of significant changes to the protocol. The trial will be registered at https:\/\/eudract.ema.europa.eu and https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Risks, side effects and disadvantages <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All procedures, including peripheral nerve blocks, are associated with possible complications, albeit very rarely (0.02-0.4%).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Known complications are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nerve injury (incidence 0.04%). Approximately 99\u00a0% of all nerve injuries resolves without treatment within one year.<\/li>\n<li>Used correctly, no side effects are seen associated with ropivacaine, but upon accidental intravascular injection, serious toxic side effects such as paresthesia, convulsions and circulatory collapse may occur. The risk of intravasal injection of the local anesthetic is minimal, and is reduced by the use of ultrasound and thorough aspiration prior to and after every 5 ml of local anesthetic.<\/li>\n<li>Systemic side effects of clonidine are transient and often mild. Sedation is normally not perceived as unpleasant. Hypotension (MAP &lt;55) can be treated by administering isotonic saline or ephedrine 10 mg. Bradycardia can occur, but rarely requires treatment. Significant bradycardia of HR&lt;40 can be treated with atropine 0.5 mg iv.<\/li>\n<li>A small hematoma can occur at the needle puncture site. This may cause tenderness but resolves without treatment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The nerve blocks will be performed using ultrasound guidance, which probably reduces the risk of complications.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There is a dose response relationship between clonidine and the prolongation of the nerve block. Most studies with positive results used a dose of 150 \u03bcg, and at the same time reports a minimum of side effects (30). Clonidine is used frequently daily at the hospital for the treatment of shivering on recovery wards after surgery and opioid abstinence in the ICU. At doses of 300 micrograms, more significant sedation and hemodynamic instability is observed (30).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A peripheral venous catheter is inserted, which rarely leads to a stinging sensation and a small hematoma after removal.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A previous trial has shown, that after the performance of an ACB, a minor motor block that will not bother the subject's mobility may be observed(27). The participants will be observed until the block resolves.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is our opinion, that risks and side effects in relation to this study is minimal, and that participation is associated with very low risk. Participation in this trial is not expected to be associated with any other nuisance, besides the already mentioned above.<\/p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\"><\/a>\u00a0<\/h2>\n<h2>Informed consent from participants<\/h2>\n<p>The participants will be recruited from the news bulletin for medical students \u201dMOK\u201d in Copenhagen.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The volunteers will be screened in a telephone interview.

El Saied (9) investigated ropivacaine with clonidine as an adjuvant perineurally vs. ropivacaine alone in a study with 50 patients. The addition of clonidine as an adjuvant prolonged the sensory blockade 489-628 minutes (95% CI 90-187). In a yet unpublished study by our group on healthy volunteers, we found a sensory duration of an ACB with 20ml ropivacaine 5 mg\/ml of 22 (SD 4) hours. Accordingly, we find that a 240 minutes prolongation of block duration will be clinically relevant. With a type 1 error risk of 5% and a type 2 error risk of 10% and an SD of 240 minutes, a total of 18 subjects is needed in this paired trial to show a difference of 240 minutes. In order to compensate for possible dropouts, we plan to include 21 participants.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\"><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data handling<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The trial ends when 21 participants are included.<\/p>\n<p>Every participant\u2019s\u00a0assessability\u00a0in the statistical analysis will be determined before the code is broken.
