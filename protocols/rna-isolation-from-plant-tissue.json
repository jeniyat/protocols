Chief among these are the critical need to avoid contamination of samples by using extreme care when moving liquids and opening and closing tubes to avoid aerosols. Because of the risk of degradation by RNase enzymes, it is essential to use sterile RNase-free equipment, disposable plastics and solutions.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>RNase degradation and contamination can be avoided by keeping samples constantly frozen at low temperature (< -80 \u00b0C) prior to adding buffers that denature or immobilize RNase. Treating equipment with RNase denaturants (e.g. RNase Zap, Ambion, Austin, TX) and solutions with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) can also prevent contamination and\/or degradation of samples, but it can have some negative effects on samples<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">1<\/span><span>.
