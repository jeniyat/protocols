Data were divided according to the generally accepted cutoffs for normality, pre-acidemia, acidemia and concentrations above mean +2 SD during the second stage. The outcome measures included gross-\/fine motor function, vision, hearing, speaking and cognitive disorders, signs of central motor damage and referral to specialized pediatric services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results:<\/strong> 307 cases were available for final analyse. With normal scalp lactate concentration, the number of children with a diagnosed disorder was lower compared to the pre-acidemic\/acidemic groups, although the findings were only significant for fine motor dysfunction (p = 0.036). Elevated lactate values were significantly associated with increased risk for a poorer capacity of attention and understanding of instructions (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07-1.74), and for fine motor dysfunction (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.49) at the age of four.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong>: Higher levels of lactate in fetal scalp blood are associated with increased risk of an aberrant developmental outcome at four years of age in some areas. If scalp lactate is normal, it seems safe to allow labor to continue.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8694","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1512031529","protocol_affiliation":"MD, PH.D,MSC,MD,Prof,Ass Prof","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.k3ecyje","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2v2c4w2x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/009.png","full_name":"Nana Wiberg","created_by":"Nana Wiberg","private_link":"931B6249A642323D1BC65D2D748DC0D2","original_img":"1","username":"nana-wiberg","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":274733,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Fetal surveillance, Lactate, fetal scalp blood sampling, long-term follow up, developmental outcome, disability","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Nana Wiberg,Tobias Wirenfeldt Klausen,Tobias Tyrberg,Lennart Nordstr\u00f6m,Eva Wiberg-Itzel","authors_list":[{"name":"Nana Wiberg","affiliation":"MD, PH.D","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Tobias Wirenfeldt Klausen","affiliation":"MSC","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Tobias Tyrberg","affiliation":"MD","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Lennart Nordstr\u00f6m","affiliation":"Prof","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Eva Wiberg-Itzel","affiliation":"Ass Prof","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/009.png","username":"nana-wiberg","full_name":"Nana Wiberg","created_by":"Nana Wiberg"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"3","is_research":"1","status_info":"The study is published.
