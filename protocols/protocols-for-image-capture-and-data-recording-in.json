Photographers record information about the subjects of their photographs in a separate notebook. The information cooresponds to specimen and site data. The end goal (not outlined in this protocol) is to embed specimen and site data into the image file's XMP metadata, thus making links to shared data easier to make.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1561141298}
