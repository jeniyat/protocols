Place the mortar, pestle, scissors, paper napkins and various contents of the Protocol E kit on the work table. The mortar and pestle should have been thoroughly cleaned before the start of the analysis and so should have been the scissors. It would be convenient for you to work in or near a room with a refrigerator. In this way you will be able to keep the leaves and picrate papers cool while you work. Leaf samples should be kept refrigerated until right before preparing them for cyanide analysis. A wash area is needed for washing up the mortar and pestle after use. The mortar and pestle should be washed to avoid sample contamination with each sample ground. If the room you are working in has a tap and sink this would be ideal for washing up apparatus. A basin and water in a bucket or container could alternatively be used if the room has no washing facility. Place a small brush at the sink for scrubbing the mortar and pestle. The napkins should be used for drying the mortar and pestle and for wiping the scissors clean.

However, if you are interested in the cyanide content of petioles, its best you carry out the procedure on petioles alone. It is important that you first check the quantity of leaves in your sample before you begin cutting them up into smaller pieces. This is because, large quantities of cassava leaves need to be sub-sampled to reduce their amount before cyanide analysis. The mortar should never be filled with leaves when grinding, as a large quantity of leaves cannot be effectively and quickly ground together. That is why sub-sampling is important. The sampled leaves could also be large in size and would hence also give more than the needed amount of leaf material for cyanide analysis. Sub-sampling allows you to take a smaller but representative sample of the collected leaves. To carry out sub-sampling, you will have to cut the leaves into three parts i.e. the inner, middle and outer leaf parts as shown in Fig 1. <\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"> <\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"> <\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Put the inner leaf parts together and cut them up into smaller pieces (1 cm x 1 cm or smaller) using a scissors.

Cyanide in leaves of crops other than cassava can also be prepared and analysed using this protocol. The picrate paper method for leaf cyanide determination relies on endogenous enzymes to breakdown the cyanogenic glucosides (linamarine) in fresh cassava leaf samples. In this protocol cassava leaves are crushed to bring together the cell contents of cassava leaves, including the enzyme linamarase and the cyanogenic glucosides. Hydrogen cyanide is liberated in the process and it reacts with picrate papers that have a colour pigment which darkens with released cyanide. The variations in the darkening of picrate papers is then used to measure the amount of hydrogen cyanide released from fresh cassava leaf samples. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol has been already well outlined by Dr J.H.
