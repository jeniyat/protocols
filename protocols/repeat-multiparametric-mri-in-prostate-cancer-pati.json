Patients<br \/>were followed according to the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol and additional mpMRIs. The primary end points were GS upgrading (GU) (&gt;3+3) in protocol-based biopsies and protocol-based TC.<br \/><br \/>Results: 53\/76 (69%) patients had progression (PIRADS upgrade, size increase or new<br \/>lesion[s]), 18\/76 (24%) had radiologically stable disease, and 5\/76 (7%) had regression<br \/>(PIRADS or size decrease, disappearance of lesion[s]) in repeat mpMRIs during AS. PIRADS<br \/>scores 4 to 5 in the initial mpMRI was associated with GU (p=0.008) and protocol-based TC<br \/>(p=0.009). Tumour progression on repeat mpMRIs was associated with TC (p=0.045) but not with<br \/>GU (p=1.00). PIRADS scores 4-5 predict GU (sensitivity 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI);<br \/>0.51-0.95, specificity 0.62 [95% CI; 0.52-0.77]) with PPV and NPV values of 0.34 (95% CI;<br \/>0.21-0.55) and 0.93 (95% CI; 0.80-0.98), respectively.<br \/><br \/>Conclusion: mpMRI is a useful tool not only to select but also to monitor PCa<br \/>patients on AS.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8075","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1507124572","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Urology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital,Medical Imaging Center, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital,Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital,Finnish Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.j66crhe","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2t274x2x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Juho Eineluoto","created_by":"Juho Eineluoto","private_link":"3E61DFA8D0527B1C77723BF3B05E78D4","original_img":"1","username":"juho-eineluoto","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0189272","manuscript_citation":"Eineluoto JT,  J\u00e4rvinen P,  Kentt\u00e4mies A,  Kilpel\u00e4inen TP,  Vasarainen H,  Sandeman K,  Erickson A,  Mirtti T,  Rannikko A (2017) Repeat multiparametric MRI in prostate cancer patients on active surveillance.
