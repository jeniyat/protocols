Patients<br \/>were followed according to the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol and additional mpMRIs. The primary end points were GS upgrading (GU) (&gt;3+3) in protocol-based biopsies and protocol-based TC.<br \/><br \/>Results: 53\/76 (69%) patients had progression (PIRADS upgrade, size increase or new<br \/>lesion[s]), 18\/76 (24%) had radiologically stable disease, and 5\/76 (7%) had regression<br \/>(PIRADS or size decrease, disappearance of lesion[s]) in repeat mpMRIs during AS. PIRADS<br \/>scores 4 to 5 in the initial mpMRI was associated with GU (p=0.008) and protocol-based TC<br \/>(p=0.009). Tumour progression on repeat mpMRIs was associated with TC (p=0.045) but not with<br \/>GU (p=1.00). PIRADS scores 4-5 predict GU (sensitivity 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI);<br \/>0.51-0.95, specificity 0.62 [95% CI; 0.52-0.77]) with PPV and NPV values of 0.34 (95% CI;<br \/>0.21-0.55) and 0.93 (95% CI; 0.80-0.98), respectively.<br \/><br \/>Conclusion: mpMRI is a useful tool not only to select but also to monitor PCa<br \/>patients on AS.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8075","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1506923792","protocol_affiliation":"Department
