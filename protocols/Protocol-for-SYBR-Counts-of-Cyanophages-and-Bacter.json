This can initially be addressed by doubling the amount of SYBR used, but it is a sign that the stock should soon be replaced.<br \/><\/em><br \/>- &nbsp; Antifade mounting solution: 50% glycerol, 50% PBS (120 mM salt, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), 0.1% phenylenediamine (Sigma cat#P6001).<br \/><em>Original protocol says to add the phenylenediamine from a 10% stock; however the maximum solubility of the free base is only 4.1 g\/mL (the 10% concentration can be prepared by adding HCl to make the chloride salt). To make the stock, dissolve the powder in filtered deionized water by vortexing and adding HCl as needed; wrap in aluminum foil and stare at -20&deg;C. Stock is light and temperature sensitive, and will go darker with time, corresponding to a decline in quality. A fresh free base solution is pink-orange while the chloride salt is purple. Use of antifade made with poor (e.g. brown or black) phenylenediamine may result in slides with particles that appear faint or seem to fade with time; with a brown stock this may be corrected by using a higher (e.g. 5x) concentration of phenylenediamine.&nbsp;<\/em><br \/><em>An alternative (which we have been recently doing) is making a 1% stock of the free base dissolved in 50% PBS, 50% glycerol. A fresh stock of this should be pinkish in color. The advantage of using this is several-fold: first, adding concentrated acid is no longer necessary; second, because the stock is more dilute it should be used up faster, so that it will need to be remade more often and thus remain fresher; third because it is 50% glycerol it does not freeze at -20 thus saving thawing time.<\/em><br \/><br \/>- &nbsp; Sample, autoclaved seawater, Petri dish, pipettes and tips, dessicator, kimwipes, syringe, and 0.02 &micro;m 25 mm Anotop filters.<br \/><br \/><strong>Source:<\/strong> from the original protocol (July 2001), adapted to working with cyanophages.&nbsp;<br \/>Noble, T.T., and J.A.
