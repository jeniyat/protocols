The ultrastructureal morphology\u00a0of\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Schistosoma mansoni\u00a0<\/span><span>and\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. japonicum\u00a0<\/span><span>has revealed the existence of two secretory cell masses surrounding the esophagus tube, referred to as the anterior and posterior esophageal glands (antESO and postESO, respectively). We recently established that the esophageal glands have a pivotal role in the first steps of blood processing. For instance, erythrocytes and leucocytes are quickly processed along the esophagus before they are propelled to the lower parts of the intestines for further digestion nutrient uptake. We propose that incorrect functioning of alimentary tract is associated with worms death by starvation. This was first observed in the self-cure response of Rhesus macaque (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Macaca mulatta<\/span><span>), one of few known vertebrate\u00a0hosts capable of combating the disease through worm elimination once the infection is stablished.\u00a0Classical immunoproteomics (2D-PAGE and Western blotting) has revealed potential targets in both exposed tegument and secreted gut proteins. Recently, a more detailed\u00a0investigation using <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. japonicum<\/span><span>\u00a0in the Rhesus model shed light on the possible operating mechanisms that prevent parasite feeding on blood. In addition, ultrastructural studies and immunocytochemistry on surviving worms indicated the esophageal lumen and the gland secretions as the primary targets of a potent and protective humoral immune response that ultimately disrupts the esophageal functions. Therefore, the molecular characterisation of the esophageal gland constituents is imperative\u00a0if one intends to emulate the Rhesus self-cure response for therapeutic purposes. However, this is not a trivial task as\u00a0challenges are multiple. Perhaps, the most important caveat is that both anterior and posterior parts of the oesophageal gland represent a minor fraction of the whole parasite body (or even of its head), meaning that dominant constituents, such as those derived from muscle tissues, suppress the identification of a unique set of gland products. Indeed, our recent investigation on the soluble protein composition of a\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. mansoni<\/span><span>\u00a0preparation failed to detect the presence of gland products attesting for their low abundance in the whole worm. Although optimized protocols for chemical\/enzymatic dissection are\u00a0reported for\u00a0isolation of testes and ovary of adult worms, no method\u00a0has proved feasible for gastrodermal epithelium and the esophageal gland cells. We tackled these challenges by developing a dissection technique on worms preserved in RNAlater solution aided by an essential set of scissors and tweezers that delivers adequate precision during the procedure. The method herein described is compatible with downstream proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry and has permitted a large-scale characterisation of proteins expressed in the <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. mansoni <\/span><span>esophagus and gastrodermis. This methodology can be applied in the molecular characterisation of other schistosome organs and tissues that present a well-defined anatomic location.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1560646118}
