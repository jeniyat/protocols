There are two reasons for this: (1) if measured simultaneously, the researcher can estimate virus production throughout the experiment, rather than relying simply on bacterial production estimates from time zero; and (2) bottle effects are common in small-volume experiments such as these. Measurements of bacterial production throughout the experiment will help the researcher to identify times when bacterial production is heightened (or reduced) due to bottle effects.<br \/><br \/><strong>Calculation of virus production and removal rates<br \/><br \/><\/strong>\u00a0Production and removal rates are calculated from the equations of Glibert et al. (1982) and Fuhrman (1987). The decay constant, k, is calculated as<br \/><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bb9c2xe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"99\" height=\"68\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bb9c2xe.png\" data-ofn=\"FLV tracer eq 1.png\" \/><br \/>where t is the incubation time and R<sub>0<\/sub> and R<sub>t<\/sub> are the ratios of labeled to unlabeled viruses at time 0 and time t, respectively.

For each experiment, initial rates (using the first two time points, t<sub>0<\/sub> and t<sub>1<\/sub>) and overall rates (using the entire time course) of production and decay are calculated. Initial rates of decay\/production are closest to in situ rates, as all of the experiments can be started at dusk and held under ambient natural conditions. Overall rates represent decay\/production under natural conditions for ~12 h, but samples held in the dark the following morning should not be exposed to natural sunlight.<br \/><br \/>Estimates of viral-induced bacterial mortality can be calculated using overall rates of virus production, mean viral abundance, mean bacterial abundance and growth rates, and either an empirically measured or estimated burst size. Briefly, virus\u00a0production rates are divided by the estimated burst size (we used a range from 20 to 50) to determine the number of bacterial cells killed L<sup>\u20131<\/sup> day<sup>\u20131<\/sup>.
