One recently established treatment is the implantation of flow diverters (FD). Methods to predict their treatment success before or directly after implantation are not well investigated yet. The aim of this work was to quantitatively study hemodynamic parameters in patient-specific models of treated cerebral aneurysms and its correlation with the clinical outcome. Hemodynamics were evaluated using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and phase contrast (PC) MRI. For preoperative and postoperative distribution of hemodynamic parameters, CFD simulations and PC-MRI velocity measurements showed similar results. In both cases where no occlusion of the aneurysm was observed after six months, a flow reduction of about 30-50% was found, while in the clinically successful case with complete occlusion of the aneurysm after 6 months, the flow reduction was about 80%. No vortex was observed in any of the three models after treatment. The results are in agreement with recent studies suggesting that CFD simulations can predict treatment success or failure already before implantation of an FD and PC-MRI could validate the predicted hemodynamic changes right after implantation of an FD.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8364","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1508780523","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Neuroradiology,  Klinikum rechts der Isar of Technical Univeristy of Munich, Munich, Germany,Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tambov State Technical University, Tambov, Russia,Department of Building Services Engineering, Chemical Engineering for Paper and Packaging, Print and Media Technologies, Munich University of Applied Sciences, Munich, Germany,Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Ludwig-Maximilian-University of Munich, Munich, Germany,Department of Fluid Dynamics and Technical Flows, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kekctcw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2v234z2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png","full_name":"Philipp Arnold","created_by":"Philipp Arnold","private_link":"6091649852528C560E73670AAEF0682A","original_img":"1","username":"philipp-arnold","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0190696","manuscript_citation":"Sindeev S,  Arnold PG,  Frolov S,  Prothmann S,  Liepsch D,  Balasso A,  Berg P,  Kaczmarz S,  Kirschke JS (2018) Phase-contrast MRI versus numerical simulation to quantify hemodynamical changes in cerebral aneurysms after flow diverter treatment.
