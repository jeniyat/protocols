The goal of this study is to shed light on research experiences and practices regarding ego depletion. A PubMed search resulted in 1721 researchers who had previously published on ego depletion. They were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. The respondents (<em>n<\/em> = 277), on average, had published over three papers on ego depletion, and had completed more than two additional, unpublished studies. Respondents indicated that in more than 40% of their studies, results were similar in magnitude to those reported in the existing literature, and more than 60% reported conducting a priori power analyses. 39.2% of respondents were aware of other researchers who engaged in questionable research practices, while 37.7% affirmed to have used questionable research practices. These results underline the importance of reducing questionable research practices to reliably test the validity of the strength model.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9441","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1515142151","protocol_affiliation":"University of Bern,","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mf9c3r6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2x2c4v2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","full_name":"Chris Englert","created_by":"Chris Englert","private_link":"7EF13A7619031858865FC8FB86162F8B","original_img":"1","username":"chris-englert","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":282996,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Chris Englert,Wanja Wolff,Lorena Baumann","authors_list":[{"name":"Chris Englert","affiliation":"University of Bern","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Wanja Wolff","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Lorena Baumann","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","username":"chris-englert","full_name":"Chris Englert","created_by":"Chris Englert"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[]}
