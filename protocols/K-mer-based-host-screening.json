be\u00a0faster than traditional use of BLAST. \u00a0This application uses\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.genome.umd.edu\/jellyfish.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jellyfish<\/a>\u00a0to index host FASTA files, then uses the mode value (default 2)\u00a0of the number of matching k-mers (default k=20) from the input sequence\u00a0to determine whether the sequence is similar enough to the host sequence to be rejected. \u00a0The output of the app is:<br \/><br \/>\n<ul>\n<li>\"screened\" directory containing the sequences from each file that were found to be dissimlar to the host<\/li>\n<li>\"rejected\" directory containing the sequence from each file that were too similar to the host<\/li>\n<li>\"jf\" directory containing Jellyfish indexes of each \"host\" file (useful for later runs with other files to skip recreating)<\/li>\n<li>\"kmer\" directory containing k-mers of query sequences and \".loc\" file showing the number of \".kmer\" lines associated to each sequence<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nCode is
