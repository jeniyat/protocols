In the central region of (Mount) Kenya, despite increasing awareness about this condition, the magnitude as well as the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors leading to falls in the elderly are not well known. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The main objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of falls, their outcomes, and the factors influencing their occurrence among the elderly persons living in Gatanga Sub-County, Murang\u2019a County, central Kenya. An analytical cross-sectional study design was used. Using systematic random sampling, 426 out of 9247 study participants were identified and interviewed at home. Using a structured interview form, data was collected on socio-demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and medical factors, as well as on fall or non-fall status from September 2016 to August 2017.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">With 41%, the prevalence of falls amongst the elderly in this region is high. The farming lifestyle involving animal husbandry and medical illnesses are significantly associated with falls. To reduce the occurrence of falls, we need to better understand the underlying contributing factors and the integration of relevant preventive measures that reduce the risk of falls in communities of the elderly.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1554790565}
