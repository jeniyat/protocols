In the United States, more than 4,000 children are diagnosed with brain tumors each year. Although approximately 70% of newly diagnosed children with CNS tumors survive after receiving standard treatment, the disease is often fatal in approximately 30% of relapsed children.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Nick Vitanza, a neurosurgeon at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital and chief researcher of the BrainChild-01 trial, said: \u201cAlthough the survival rate has improved, many of the children we care about have relapsed without life-saving treatment options. We must find one.

When targeting this protein, CAR-T cells will be able to find and destroy tumor cells while retaining healthy brain tissue that does not express HER2.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Compared with hematological tumors, the goals of solid tumor therapy are very challenging because they express multiple proteins and are difficult to reach. They look for markers that are present in many types of tumors but not in healthy brain tissue. At the time, we were pleased to discover that HER2 may be a common clue to help us target several brain tumors we treat in children.\"<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Vitanza and a team led by Dr. Mike Jensen of the Ben Towne Children\u2019s Cancer Research Center at the Seattle Children\u2019s Institute plan to recruit at least 18 patients during the trial. After the researchers confirmed HER2 expression, the patients were divided into two groups according to their location. After reprogramming the patient's T cells, those children in the first group will be intubating their T cells into the tumor resection cavity. The second group of children will inject their T cells into their CNS ventricular system via a catheter.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By injecting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creative-biolabs.com\/car-t\/cellrapeutics-chimeric-antigen-receptor-car-technology.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CAR T<\/a> cells directly into the brain rather than into the bloodstream, the researchers believe that this delivery will be more effective because T cells do not need to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (which tends to prevent drugs from reaching the brain to reach the necessary concentration). Researchers also hope that patients may have fewer side effects, such as neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome, because reprogrammed T cells do not circulate extensively in the blood. This clinical trial will examine the safety and feasibility of this method.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Patients will receive one dose of CAR-T cell infusion per week, and in this study, they may need to receive up to six doses of treatment. Based on the patient's response to the experimental treatment and tolerance, they can choose to continue to receive more doses.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>BrainChild-01 is Seattle's next step for children seeking to use the immune system to bring better treatment and treatment to children around the world. With clinical trials of T-cell immunotherapy open to children and young adults, Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital will work to improve this treatment for childhood cancer to help patients achieve their ultimate goal of long-term remission.
