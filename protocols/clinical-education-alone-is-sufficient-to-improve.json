Clinical guidelines from the National Stroke Foundation (NSF) Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management and the American Heart Association Statement for Stroke both recommend strength training for the lower limb to improve walking. Further, clinical guidelines have also been published by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for optimal strength training. However, despite a large body of evidence that muscle weakness is the primary impairment causing walking limitations, and guidelines recommending strength training during rehabilitation, six systematic reviews have demonstrated that the application of the NSF guidelines has not improved walking outcomes. Our research indicates that the gap is within the NSF guidelines. The NSF guidelines are vague and lack the \u2018How To\u2019 direction for the implementation of their strength training recommendations. The aim of this research project is to develop an education and training package for implementing the ACSM guidelines for strength training, and test whether it is effective in order to direct the application of the NSF guidelines.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1551369963}
