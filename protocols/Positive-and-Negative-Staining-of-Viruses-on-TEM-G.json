Positive staining stains the virus itself such that the virus is dark against a lighter background (Figure 1A). This is the easiest staining to do and yields results suitable for analyzing the morphological diversity of viruses from aquatic samples. Negative staining relies on some stain remaining around the edges of a virus such that the details of the virus are clearly defined (Figure 1B). Negative staining is more difficult and is used to obtain publication quality micrographs of viruses.<br \/><br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/f7c2w6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"132\" \/><br \/><br \/><strong>Note:<\/strong> To deposit viruses onto the grids prior to staining, use either the &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/protocols.io\/view\/Adsorbing-Viruses-on-TEM-Grids-dar2d5\" target=\"_blank\">Adsorbing Viruses onto TEM Grids<\/a>&rdquo; protocol or the &ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/Quantitatively-Depositing-Viruses-onto-TEM-Grids-cwzxf5\" target=\"_blank\">Quantitatively Depositing Viruses onto TEM Grids<\/a>&rdquo; protocol.
