Spotting environmental samples on lawns of a target host cell would thus reveal the presence of a lytic phage for that particular host cell in the given sample.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"1490","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1441045598","protocol_affiliation":"Manual of Aquatic Viral Ecology","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.dps5nd","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2v2b433v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","full_name":"Amy Chan","created_by":"Amy Chan","private_link":"99B2B55FF54EB3363DBBD50C3B007ECC","original_img":"1","username":"amy-chan","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":222859,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"45","group_uri":"verve-net","group_name":"VERVE Net","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/cdqcwwe.png","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"},{"group_id":"81","group_uri":"suttle-laboratory-of-marine-molecular-microbiology","group_name":"Suttle Laboratory of Marine Molecular Microbiology and Virology","group_logo":"","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[{"protocol_name":"Isolation and life cycle characterization of lytic viruses infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria","protocol_name_html":"Isolation and life cycle characterization of lytic viruses infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria","uri":"Isolation-and-life-cycle-characterization-of-lytic-dxq7mv","username":"amy-chan","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","full_name":"Amy Chan"}],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Mathias Middelboe, Amy M.
