A field experiment involving 29 patients was designed and participants were either assigned to the study group (N=13 patients who finished the study and used a self-tracking device) or the control group (N=16 patients who finished the study and did not use a device). For both groups data about physiological performance during cardiac stress test was collected at the beginning (baseline), in the middle (in week 6), and at the end of the study (after 12 weeks). Comparing the physiological performance of both groups, the data showed significant differences. The participants in the study group not only maintained the same performance level as during the midterm examination in week 6, they improved performance even further during the six weeks that followed. The results provide evidence for positive effects of digital self-tracking by patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation on performance of the cardiovascular system. In this way, our study provides novel insight about the effects of the use of smart wearables by chronic disease patients. Our findings have implications for the design of self-management approaches in a patient rehabilitation setting. In essence, the use of smart wearables can prolong the success of the rehabilitation outside of the organized rehabilitation setting.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>A consent form has to be signed by the patient and the responsible author after all patient questions were answered satisfactorily; hence the patient completely understands the way in which the study will be conducted, is aware of his rights as a participant, is willing to consent to participation and confirmes that he\/she had had enough time to think about whether he\/she wishes to participate in the study or not.<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"<p>All measures have to be performed by a medical doctor or a trained exercise physiologist (under supervision of a medical doctor, to deal with any emergencies).<\/p>","version_class":"7426","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1503172436","protocol_affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria; CARDIOMED Outpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation Centre, Linz,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria; Johannes Kepler University Linz,Dublin City University,CARDIOMED Outpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation Centre, Linz","affiliation":"Johannes Kepler University Linz","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jhacj2e","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Jrgen-x2237413y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/007.png","full_name":"J\u00fcrgen Vogel","created_by":"J\u00fcrgen Vogel","private_link":"9A85D61751B2B64C799955F700585D4A","original_img":"1","username":"jrgen-vogel","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0186261","manuscript_citation":"Vogel J,  Auinger A,  Riedl R,  Kindermann H,  Helfert M,  Ocenasek H (2017) Digitally enhanced recovery: Investigating the use of digital self-tracking for monitoring leisure time physical activity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation.
