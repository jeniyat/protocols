To have a successful breeding, accurate monitoring of the reproductive activity is necessary. The use of non-invasive monitoring methods in exotics is important in order to minimize stress. For this purpose, ultrasound has been anecdotally used to monitor royal python reproductive activity. However, there is limited information regarding the reproductive cycle of this species. The aim of the present study is to monitor the female reproductive cycle of the royal python using ultrasonography and gonadal steroid metabolite measurements in the faeces. The reproductive activity of one hundred twenty-nine adult female <em>P. regius<\/em> was examined during two consecutive years. We performed brief scans on non-anaesthetized snakes using a portable ultrasound system and a 10-12 MHz linear array transducer (MyLab\u2122 30 Gold, Esaote). Ultrasound features, dimension and echogenicity of the reproductive structures were determined. During the second reproductive cycle, the hormonal profiles of 30 animals were also evaluated, with a monthly collection of faecal samples. These samples were classified according to reproductive stage, and the mean faecal progesterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol levels were calculated using the results from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Progesterone levels increased during the reproductive cycle. estradiol levels showed greater variability, although they appeared to increase before coupling when compared to the levels between coupling and egg laying. The present study suggests that it is possible to identify different phases in the female royal python reproductive cycle: anovulatory phase, transition, folliculogenesis and embryogenesis. Ultrasound is also useful for identifying follicular regression or slugs. Gonadal steroid metabolite measurements from the faeces could help integrate the reproductive information. The use of ultrasonography in addition with the steroid metabolite measurement in the faeces gives an accurate picture of ovarian activity in captive adult female royal pythons.\u2003<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8787","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1510747707","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Veterinary Science, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Parma, Via Del Taglio, Parma, Italy,Ambulatorio Veterinario Belvedere, Reggio Emilia, Italy,Department of Veterinary Science, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Torino, Via Leonardo da Vinci, Grugliasco (TO), Italy,Tai Wai Small Animal and Exotic Hospital, Hong Kong","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kttcwnn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2w244v2q2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/013.png","full_name":"Mara Bertocchi","created_by":"Mara Bertocchi","private_link":"33C790E9EB47A0E281BE94DA067D4856","original_img":"1","username":"mara-bertocchi","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0199377","manuscript_citation":"Bertocchi M,  Pelizzone I,  Parmigiani E,  Ponzio P,  Macchi E,  Righi F,  Girolamo ND,  Bigliardi E,  Denti L,  Bresciani C,  Ianni FD (2018) Monitoring the reproductive activity in captive bred female ball pythons (<i>P<\/i>. <i>regius<\/i>) by ultrasound evaluation and noninvasive analysis of faecal reproductive hormone (progesterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol) metabolites trends.
