Viral RNA is widespread in the brain of most animals positive for rabies. However, because virus spread may be unilateral, especially in larger animals, a negative finding for rabies can be made only if a complete cross section of the brain stem is examined. Examination may be made at the level of the pons, medulla, or midbrain of the brain stem.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>While a negative finding for rabies can be made only if a full cross section of brain stem tissue is examined, incomplete or suboptimal specimens should be tested, if possible. Identification of rabies virus RNA in any tissue is diagnostic of rabies infection [1, 2]. Examples of samples that may be tested for rabies virus RNA to rule-in (but not rule-out) rabies infection are hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex, saliva, and nuchal skin biopsy.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Definitions and Keywords<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BSC \u2013 Biological Safety Cabinet<\/p>\n<p>PPE \u2013 Personal Protective Equipment<\/p>\n<p>Room Temperature \u2013 Temperature range of 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quality Control and Corrective Action <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All issues, comments, concerns, or deviations from the protocol are to be documented and brought to the attention of the lab supervisor or technical supervisor immediately if they are thought to affect the quality of the end product in any aspect.<\/li>\n<li>Temperature levels are to be monitored on applicable equipment to ensure incubators, refrigerators, and freezers stay within criteria set for acceptable temperature range.<\/li>\n<li>Specimen will be assigned based on the test ordered and\/or the recommendations of the technical supervisor or lab supervisor.<\/li>\n<li>All samples are to have unique identifiers and corresponding accession labels provided in advance of starting the necropsy procedure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"<p><strong>Hazards and Safety Precautions <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Samples may contain infectious agent(s).
