Please note that, if the investigator requires rodents from a non-approved vendor, he\/she has certain responsibilities. The investigator's cooperation in following these policies is essential. If an investigator does not abide by the policy and animals are either ordered or arrive unexpectedly, they will not be accepted. In order to protect our pathogen-free colonies from exposure to new pathogens, the following procedures are to be followed: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">          1.2.1 Justification of need and health concerns must be reviewed by the MBP veterinarian. The following must be submitted in written form:  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">                    1.2.1.1 Investigator must scientifically justify the need, and include the lack of alternative specific-pathogen-free sources to the IACUC.

Serologic surveillance data sampled within two months of proposed shipment date on the source colony must be presented. The source colony must test negative to the commonly occurring murine pathogens. All rodents must be tested for mites, pinworms and helicobactor. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">                   1.2.2.2 A written statement of the general overall health of the animals from the source veterinarian is required.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">           1.2.3 Evaluation of the information will be made by the MBP veterinarian.

If rodents need to be taken to a laboratory, surgical facility, or other area prior to quarantine where they may possibly contaminate other rodents, protocols would be developed to minimize or preclude inadvertent cross-contamination.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.6 The import\/export manager will proceed with importation arrangements. The PI will be contacted and asked to provide the following information:  Address where invoice is to be sent. Account number for animal care or if paying by check. (Payment procedure memo is sent with the first invoice.) <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.7 The purchasing officer must be contacted prior to placing the order. A Special Request Form must be received before the order can be processed.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.8 The PI will be contacted notifying him\/her of expected arrival date of the animals by the import\/export manager.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.9 On arrival, the animals will be placed in importation quarantine for 4-6 weeks. Samples will be collected from sentinels exposed to dirty bedding, and tested for murine pathogens listed as above. During quarantine, all personnel must follow guidelines posted on door for entry. Animals may be utilized for research during this time (i.e. breeding) but must NOT leave the quarantine room. Exceptions must be discussed with the MBP veterinarian.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.10 Once test results are received and are negative, the MBP veterinarian will approve the release of animals from quarantine.
