Adrenal hormones were determined within the first 24 hours of the septic process. To determine and compare the predictive ability of each marker for the risk of unfavorable evolution (in-hospital, 28-day and 90-day mortality), ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined. As measures of association, adjusted odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression.

Associations between high cortisol levels (>17.5 \u00b5g\/dL) and mortality were strong and statistically significant for in-hospital and 28-day mortality: adjusted ORs 10.13 and 9.45 respectively, and lower for long term mortality (90 days): adjusted OR 4.26 (95% CI 1.34-13.56), p trend 0.014.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Regarding adrenal androgens, only positive associations were obtained for DHEAS and most of these positive associations did not yield statistical significance.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Regarding Cortisol\/DHEA and cortisol\/DHEAS ratios, they did not improve the predictive ability of cortisol.
