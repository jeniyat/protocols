Blood pressure is low when anesthetized with isoflurane, and better with KX, which facilitates blood sampling. On the other hand, the recovery time for isoflurane is very short (a minute after cessation of administration); KX takes longer, according to dosage (half an hour to an hour, depending on species). Warming (heating) pads are useful, since anesthetized small mammals tend to hypothermia, and warmer animals have better peripherical blood flow; however, its temperature should be checked regularly to avoid overheating.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF"},{"id":693794,"guid":"6ACA79400A2611E9801E6521CC0C8D19","previous_id":693791,"previous_guid":"C8AB4A000A2411E9801E6521CC0C8D19","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"F894A0614888442A87066DE6B1127B58","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Mark and release"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"04072961DC484CCB96F72F26B88482CF","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Once small mammals are completely recovered from anesthesia, they should be transported as explained in Step 8 and released at their exact point of capture.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92"}],"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Brief guide to trapping and blood-sampling of small terrestrial mammals, including materials, procedures and recommendations.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1550333164}
