Given the lack of an incentive structure, I observed a steady decrease in the percentage of adult attendees screened daily in some <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Puskesmas, <\/span><span>indicating a decline in commitment which prompted me to consider an incentive structure for the substantive study. Nonetheless, 5341 patients were screened within the recruitment week.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The evaluation of question 2 indicated that the provision of one research assistant per clinic to manage the screening of all adult primary care attendees raised minor challenges. As the research assistant had to conduct recruitment by explaining the trial objectives to those meeting the screening criteria, several adult primary care attendees were left unscreened every day. To further complicate matters, older patients required help with reading the screening questionnaire which rendered other patients neglected. It was also tricky for research assistants to manage four separate documents for each patient: screening questionnaire, information sheet, informed consent sheet, and the questionnaire booklet. All this need to be compiled with clinician\u2019s assessment following the psychiatric interview. I noticed the potential for the mismanagement of paperwork by research assistants. Despite the challenges, the proposed procedure proved to be feasible. A focus group with five research assistants and local adviser, Dr Bambang Hastha Yoga, discussed potential mitigating strategies for the substantive trial, including having a pair of research assistants per <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Puskesmas<\/span><span>, which were eventually implemented in the substantive trial. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The evaluation of question 3 indicated an inconsistency of confidence among clinicians to conduct in-depth psychiatric interviews during busy clinic hours. The pilot study highlighted that with limited time, such as during general practitioner\u2019s consultation, it was difficult for clinicians to ask questions relating to symptoms of psychiatric morbidity. Given the interest in also conducting a Receiver Operating Curve study on the GHQ-12, a gold standard against which the threshold scores could be compared to was required. Given the precedent set by similar studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, under the advice of Professor Martin Prince of King\u2019s College London, I incorporated the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) which is a structured interview guide to assess the symptoms of psychiatric disorders efficiently.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Subtle changes to the substantive study were made, including assigning two research assistants per clinic and converting the information sheets, informed consent sheets, questionnaire batteries, and structured psychiatric interview guide into booklet form. In addition, I extended the recruitment period of the substantive study to two weeks.

The WHODAS 2.0 covers six domains of functioning, including Cognition; Mobility; Self-care; Getting along; Life activities; and Participation. This trial used the 36-item, self-administered version, taking approximately 20 minutes for self-completion. This trial used the complex scoring method based on item response theory, as advised by the WHO. It took the coding for each item separately and then used an algorithm to determine the Total score by differentially weighting the items and the levels of severity. Total scores are in a metric ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (full disability).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The 3-level European Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D-3L) is a standardised self-report measure of health-related quality of life which takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. It comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression, with each dimension recording  responses at one of three levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems (Lewis and Pelosi, 1990). EQ-5D-3L ratings are commonly converted into composite utility scores using country-specific value sets, which measure people\u2019s preferences in relation to health and weight each of the levels in each EQ-5D-3L dimension accordingly. The single utility scores represent the state of health-related quality of life for a person at any given time. While the Indonesian value set for the 5-level version of the measure (EQ-5D-5L) has been published in 2016, there is no existing value set for EQ-5D-3L. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Existing Thai and Malaysian value sets were found to be the closest alternative.

Both value sets include the N3 model from the original UK Measure and Valuation in Health study.

The CIS-R is a fully structured diagnostic instrument that was developed from an existing instrument, the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS), initially designed for the use of clinically experienced interviewers. The CIS was revised and developed into a fully structured interview to increase standardisation and to make it suitable to be used by trained lay interviewers in assessing minor psychiatric morbidity in the community, general hospital, occupational and primary care research. As the CIS-R specifically diagnoses mood and anxiety disorders, participants with an indication of other disorders (psychosis, sleep disorders, dementia) were asked additional questions which enabled the interviewers (clinicians) to establish an ICD-10 diagnosis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>For this trial, structured interview using the CIS-R was conducted by general practitioners or clinical psychologists in all participating <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Puskesmas<\/span><span>.

In the CIS-R, there are 14 different symptom groups which participants were asked to consider, regarding the last month prior to the interview, focusing on symptoms experienced within the last week. The 14 symptoms enquired after were: (1) Somatic symptoms; (2) Fatigue; (3) Sleep problems; (4) Irritability; (5) Physical health worries; (6) Depression; (7) Depressive ideas; (8) Worry; (9) Anxiety; (10) Phobias; (11) Panic; (12) Compulsive behaviours; (13) Obsessive thoughts; (14) Forgetfulness\/concentration problems. Scores on each symptom group ranged from 0 to 4 (and 0 to 5 for depressive ideas), and Total CIS-R Scores are the sum of each symptom group with higher scores indicating higher levels of symptomatology.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The following were secondary outcomes:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"> Changes from baseline to the 6-month follow-up assessment in the disability of participants, as measured by WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) (Sousa et al., 2010).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"> Quality-adjusted life year at 6-month follow-up, as computed using the European Quality of Life Scale (EQ\u20105D-3L) (Oppe et al., 2007). <\/li><\/ol><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Attempts were made to collect reasons for treatment discontinuation and loss to follow-up.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":807619,"guid":"DF9147A0CB3B11E998147D229186118A","previous_id":807618,"previous_guid":"BA6B3D50CB3B11E998147D229186118A","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"CBC7741FD45343BE93DEFC7B7A5EE0C8","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Measures"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"1A62947F916E44099895D97826F6EE34","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The GHQ-12, HoNOS, WHODAS 2.0, and EQ-5D in Bahasa Indonesia existed prior to the conception of this trial.

The standard deviation of 5.21 and clinical significance threshold used is the only available data on HoNOS reported from a sample of patients from eight National Health Service outpatient and community psychotherapy services in England.

The cluster randomisation might result in reduced efficiency and loss of power because the within-cluster responses tend to be more similar than those of individuals from different clusters (commonalities in the selection, exposure, shared environment, mutual interaction). A larger sample size was therefore needed to compensate for this clustering effect. Our approach is simplified because it does not consider variations in the number of participants in each cluster. Although this type of imbalance in cluster size may reduce the power of the trial, the loss is negligible for studies with more than 100 patients per arm (Guittet et al., 2006). Based on the additional assumption of an ICC of 0.1, the number of patients required would be 189 in each arm. Implementation research studies showed that in medical settings ICCs for outcome variables were generally lower than 0.05 (Campbell et al., 2005).

While the ICER allows costs and outcomes to be considered together in a decision-making context, it is calculated from four sample mean values and is therefore subject to statistical uncertainty. The uncertainty of these estimates was explored first, by bootstrapping 1000 resamples to generate a new distribution of estimates and plotting these onto a cost-effectiveness plane for interpretation and then, by constructing cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC). The CEAC is a plot of the probability of the intervention being cost-effective (y-axis) for a range of willingness to pay thresholds per unit improvement in outcome (x-axis) (Fenwick et al., 2001). Initially, for the cost-utility analysis the WHO recommendation of three times GDP per capita (Rachapelle et al., 2013, Eichler et al., 2004)or a calculation based on estimates of opportunity costs (Woods et al., 2016)were considered to approximate an Indonesian willingness-to-pay threshold, but recent research on the Indonesian willingness-to-pay threshold for medical intervention enabled a more exact analysis to be conducted (Kristina et al., 2017).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":807631,"guid":"D2366FD0CB3C11E998147D229186118A","previous_id":807628,"previous_guid":"BC8C7A30CB3C11E998147D229186118A","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"3CDB9EBE68AF43FDB07043ACE6DA2FB1","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Cultural Challenges"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"41D8884D8C574BE3BC022BDB418FA0A2","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><h2>Cultural Challenges and Bias<\/h2><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Prior to the trial, SGA applied for Leave to Work Away from the University of Cambridge, in light of the fieldwork and visiting fellowship to be undertaken in Indonesia. As part of the application, SGA completed a Risk Assessment document, which helped me highlight several potential issues at the fieldwork location.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">While SGA is an Indonesian, she had not lived in the country for 16 years prior to the first fieldwork visit to Yogyakarta. During this first fieldwork, there was a terrorist attack in Jakarta, where several terrorists bombed and shot at places and people with foreign attributes, e.g. Starbucks. SGA established a regular reporting schedule with TVB and CB2 in Cambridge, to ensure that safety issues could be immediately dealt with, and if required, a return to Cambridge arranged. Having to travel accompanied, part of the Risk Assessment compromise, would also limit SGA\u2019s independence to travel between each fieldwork site, given the distance and remote location of many sites (up to four hours from the centre of Yogyakarta). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">SGA was aware of my negatively perceived identity as a double minority in Indonesia: both in ethnicity and religion. As a non-medical doctor, SGA was also at the lower end of the social power when compared to research stakeholders: Muslim, Javanese, older medical doctors working as civil servants. Despite her Cambridge affiliation, SGA did not enjoy the \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d granted to lighter-skinned researchers when working in less developed context, such as the privileges granted to Japanese Dr Nozomi Sakata when conducting research in Tanzania (Naveed et al., 2017). Conversely, as a woman ethnic Chinese Indonesian researcher who does not wear a hijab, SGA was vulnerable to discrimination at my fieldwork sites. Since SGA could not show respect by speaking High Javanese, SGA had to be especially mindful of her attire and body language when interacting with stakeholders. Greeting older and important stakeholders, SGA bowed and touched her forehead to the back of their right hand. Towards research assistants, SGA had to balance authority with Javanese politeness, aware of the secondary status of a woman in Javanese culture (Smith-Hefner, 1988).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">SGA was also aware of the rent-seeking culture of the fieldwork location, which could potentially present ethical challenges related to bribery requests, as she represented a foreign university. Prior to each data collection period, SGA would have to renew the provincial and district research licenses in person, as well as renew stakeholders\u2019 support for the project. In her role as permission seeker, stakeholders who acted as gatekeepers could potentially present challenges. In light of these potential challenges, SGA developed local collaborations and formed a fieldwork advisory team, spearheaded by the previous Dean of Universitas Gadjah Mada Faculty of Medicine (LT) and the current Director of the Centre for Public Mental Health (DS). LT is a respected figure in the medical community in Yogyakarta, and on the other hand, all Puskesmas psychologists were required to submit biannual reports to DS. Their presence in the advisory team was deemed helpful should issues arise locally during fieldwork.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>As a trained psychologist, there was also a potential that SGA had implicit bias, favouring the Specialist treatment arm over the WHO mhGAP treatment arm. Implicit bias generally tends to favour our own ingroup, and could influence the way SGA conducted training, negotiation with clinicians, her assessment of treatment outcomes, and\/or recommendations at the end of the trial. SGA ensured that all trainings prior to the pilot and substantive trials were conducted together for both <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Puskesmas<\/span><span> doctors and psychologists. To avoid clinicians feeling as though they were pitted against each other, representatives from the Provincial Health Authority opened the training sessions and provided a closing address. While SGA orchestrated the follow-up effort, research assistants who were Javanese collected patient outcomes data, introducing themselves in High Javanese as an expression of respect. The Trial Manager (CB1) was an independent party who conducted the randomisation of clusters, supervised the data analysis, and performed the ITT analysis. <\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":807634,"guid":"F01ED6E0CB3C11E998147D229186118A","previous_id":807631,"previous_guid":"D2366FD0CB3C11E998147D229186118A","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"094536400A22478087A891A35060308F","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"References"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"B51A71B1C4774D1BAF837536E9447877","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>BEECHAM, J. & KNAPP, M. 2001. <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Costing psychiatric interventions<\/span><span>, Gaskell London.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>CAMPBELL, M.

Despite its importance, mental health provisions are often limited. In 2015, Indonesia had only 773 psychiatrists for 250 million residents. This shortage of specialist mental health professionals is shared by most Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and is reflected in the Treatment Gaps in this region indicating the very small proportion of people who receive adequate mental health care for their needs. While the median worldwide Treatment Gap for psychosis is 32.2% (Kohn et al., 2004), in Indonesia it is more than 90%. Experts suggested integrating mental health care into primary care, to help bridge this gap (Mendenhall et al., 2014). The systematic introduction of the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Programme into primary care clinics across Indonesia and the presence of a 15-year-old co-location of Clinical Psychologists in Yogyakarta province\u2019s primary care clinics presented an opportunity to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of both frameworks. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods<\/span><span> This research (\u201cthe trial\u201d) set out to develop an approach, and then implement it, to compare the adapted WHO mhGAP framework with the existing specialist framework within primary mental health services in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, through a pragmatic, two-arm cluster randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. This design enabled an examination of patients derived from whole populations in a \u2018real world\u2019 setting. The trial involved two phases: a pilot study in June 2016 with the objectives to refine data collection procedures and to serve as a practice run for clinicians involved in the trial; as well as a substantive trial beginning in December 2016. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was established as a \u2018fairly accurate\u2019 screening tool using a Receiver Operating Curve study. Using the GHQ scoring method of 0-0-1-1, a threshold of 1\/2 was identified for use in clinical setting, i.e. the context of the trial. The primary outcome was the health and social functioning of participants as measured by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) and secondary outcomes were disability as measured by WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), quality of life as measured by European Quality of Life Scale (EQ\u20105D-3L), and cost of intervention evaluated from a health services perspective, which aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both frameworks at six months. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Results<\/span><span> During the recruitment period, 4944 adult primary care patients attended 27 participating primary care centres. Following screening (n=1484) and in-depth psychiatric interviews (n=394), 174 WHO mhGAP arm and 151 Specialist arm participants received a formal diagnosis and were recruited into the trial. The number of required participants per treatment arm, to provide statistical power of 0.80 and statistical bilateral significance value of 0.05 was estimated to be 96. A total of 153 participants of the WHO mhGAP arm and 141 of the Specialist arm were followed-up at six months, representing 90.8% of all participants diagnosed. At follow-up, 82% (n=126) participants of the WHO mhGAP arm indicated they had attended at least one treatment session during the trial, significantly more than in the Specialist Arm (69%; n=97), \uf0632 = 7.364, p=0.007. The WHO mhGAP arm was proven to be statistically not inferior to the Specialist arm in reducing symptoms of social and physical impairment, reducing disability, and improving health-related quality of life at six months. Cost-effectiveness analyses show that the Specialist arm was dominant for a unit of improvement in patient outcomes at six months. While the framework is more expensive for the Health System, participants in the Specialist arm were found to have larger improvements. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><span> Given that both frameworks yielded positive patient outcomes, there is no immediate need to increase the absolute number of specialist mental health professionals in community psychiatry (i.e. replicate the specialist framework outside Yogyakarta). As most psychologists and psychiatrists in Indonesia reside in large cities, the current systematic roll-out of the adapted WHO mhGAP framework might address the need to strengthen non-stigmatising mental health care within community contexts, reflecting the preferences of primary care patients. In districts or provinces which could afford the additional cost, however, the Specialist framework was shown to be better at improving patient outcomes than the adapted WHO mhGAP framework. Existing resources for specialist care can be arranged in a hub-and-spoke (step-up care) model where higher-level interventions are provided for those with greater needs. The proposed model would free-up resources for advanced clinical training of the specialist workforce in key areas of need while keeping specialist services accessible. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Trial Registration<\/span><span> This trial has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov since 25 February 2016, NCT02700490. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ethical Standards<\/span><span> Full ethics approval from the University of Cambridge, UK was received on 15 December 2015 (PRE.2015.108) and from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia on 14 April 2016 (1237\/SD\/PL.03.07\/IV\/2016). A condition of ethics approval from the University of Cambridge is that the investigator is covered by indemnity insurance and that participants are insured for the period of their participation. This was provided by the University of Cambridge Trial Insurance Office (609\/M\/C\/1510). Ethics approval from all the clusters was not required as each cluster (Puskesmas) is a local GP surgery which does not have its own ethics committee. Instead, approval to conduct research at the province of Yogyakarta including all five districts: Kota Yogyakarta, Sleman, Gunung Kidul, Kulon Progo, Bantul Districts was obtained from the Provincial Government Office (070\/REG\/V\/625\/5\/2016) following ethics approvals. Written consent to participate was obtained from clinicians taking part as well as all patient-participants.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1567180151}
