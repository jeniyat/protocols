This enzyme is essential for the GSH redox cycle which maintains adequate levels of reduced cellular GSH. A high GSH\/GSSG ratio is essential for protection against oxidative stress. The Cayman Chemical Glutathione Reductase Assay Kit measures GR activity by measuring the rate of NADPH oxidation. The oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Since GR is present at rate limiting concentrations, the rate of decrease in the A340 is directly proportional to the GR activity in the sample. The Cayman GR Assay Kit is provided in a convenient 96 well plate format and can be used to measure GR activity inplasma, erythrocyte lysates, tissue homogenates, and cell lysates.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557849225}
