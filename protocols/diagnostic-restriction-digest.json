This is particularly true if you receive a plasmid from someone in another lab, or dig one out of the freezer and you are not 100% sure it is what you are looking for, but you have a map and know exactly what it should be. A useful restriction enzyme based technique for verifying plasmids like this is \"plasmid fingerprinting\", where you cut the plasmid into 3-8 pieces such that all (or most) fragments are small enough to be accurately sized on a gel and also such that they are different enough in size to be easily resolved from each other. However, by choosing an enzyme or enzymes that will cut your plasmid into multiple fragments, you can get a very unique pattern that will distinguish one 5kb backbone with a 1.2kb insert from all others.<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bksc6.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">When choosing restriction enzymes for this approach, it is often a good idea to choose two different enzymes that will give you unique but distinct patterns so that you get double confirmation. In the example above, digestion with either RE3 or RE4 will give a very predictable pattern of bands on the gel, but by digesting with both and seeing both patterns you can be incredibly confident that you have the correct plasmid.<\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"8EB616E94B4642CFAD3A83BB8EEF059F","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bksc6.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":761263,"guid":"58114ED0938A11E9910B8DE27482ABAD","previous_id":761260,"previous_guid":"5810D9A1938A11E9910B8DE27482ABAD","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"81D96EAB17294C628AEBABED35CC35B5","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Verifying Insert Orientation by Restriction Digest"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"975D90F64975412CBB851081E2299F27","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">If you clone an insert into a vector by a single restriction enzyme, you will need to verify that it has be cloned in the correct orientation - this can be done by restriction digest. Although this is never an ideal cloning strategy, sometimes it cannot be avoided. If you do have to do so, there is no way to control which orientation the insert is ligated into the vector backbone and therefore the only thing left to do is identify the clone(s) in which the insert is in the correct orientation.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In the example below we want to know how to differentiate between two clones that differ only in the orientation of the insert. By choosing an enzyme (or enzymes) that cuts within the insert, but significantly off center (ideally around 1\/3 of the way from one end), and also cuts in the backbone on one side of the insert, you can get a very obvious verification of the orientation so long as the expected products from each orientation are different sizes. Simply run the digest products on a gel and those clones with the appropriately sized products should have the correct orientation.<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bksde.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"D6D5323E3B78453FB1483D76787F881B","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bksde.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol is for running a diagnostic restriction digest.
