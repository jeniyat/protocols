All branches of an arbor were digitized in three dimensions as the parent neurite repeatedly branched, arborized, and finally terminated. At this morphometry step, however, a percentage of the neurites had to be dropped from analysis because comprehensive Neurolucida digitization encountered a flaw, artifact, discontinuity, or intermingled branch of a neighboring arbor not seen in the earlier scanning that made identification of the target arbor problematic. Where appropriate for more qualitative observations, the arbors dropped from the morphometry analyses were retained and used for analysis of neurite distribution.
