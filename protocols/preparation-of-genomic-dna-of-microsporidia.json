Adjusted pH to 8.0 with 1 mol\/l HCl, added 10% SDS in order to attain 0.5% in the mixture and kept it in ice-bath for 15 min. 20 mg\/ml proteinase K (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. LTD) was added in order to attain 200 lg\/ml in the mixture and incubated at 50C for 4 h. Subsequently, isovolumetric tris\u2013phenol extraction was performed twice, and washed with chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v\/v). 10% NaOAC was added to the recovered aqueous phase after centrifuging (10,000 r\/min, 5 min), and then the DNA was precipitated by 2.5 times volume of cold ethanol at -20C for 40 min before centrifuging (12,000 r\/min, 10 min). In addition, the precipitated DNA was rinsed twice with 500 ll cold 70% ethanol before drying at 37C for 5\u201310 min. Then, the extracted DNA was stored at -20C after dissolution in 50 ll TE buffer at 65C for 10 min.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"6370","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1497458924","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.igacbse","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2033423v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","full_name":"Chen Gong","created_by":"Chen Gong","private_link":"0D59C233FB29133366063F497EC4FEE2","original_img":"1","username":"chen-gong","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0181703","manuscript_citation":"Chen G,  Wang W,  Chen H,  Dai W,  Peng X,  Li X,  Tang X,  Xu L,  Shen Z (2017) Functional characterization of an aquaporin from a microsporidium, <i>Nosema bombycis<\/i>.
