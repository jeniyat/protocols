The modification can occur in the amino acid side chain and its C or N terminus. More function are introduced through modification of functional groups or introduction of new groups (such as phosphates, acetyl groups, etc.). Most proteins expressed by eukaryotes undergo a series of post-translational processing and modification to become the final complex function performer, so post-translational modification of proteins becomes an important aspect of proteomics research.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1554276130}
