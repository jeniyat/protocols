This intact piece of soil kept in a box is maintained so that it is not destroyed for further processing in the laboratory. Soil trailing was immediately weighed with fresh analytical scales (accuracy of 0.01 g). The trailer was dried in the oven at 105OC for 24 hours and weighed a constant dry weight.<\/span><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Lab analysis:<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculation of organic content and soil minerals is done by using an auger to take the soil layer on horizon A with 10 cm deep. Taken approximately 10 grammes of soil and put in a sealed container known to its weight. Using the scales, weighed to form a fresh weight. In the laboratory, soil samples are fed into an oven of 105\u00b0C to a constant weight. Let it cool for a while and weigh the dry weight of the soil. Taken extracts of dry soil 5 grammes of dry soil and then put into a dry porcelain that has been known to weigh. The spraying process can be done with a high-temperature furnace or furnace (450<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C) for 4 hours. After that, the sample was cooled in the desiccator and weighed the soil weight of the soil.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"950036","previous_id":"950035","original_id":"0","guid":"3259325B516A45D88BE3ECD38B62EE46","previous_guid":"843A742B01294D629DA96B1965F01151","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Measure edaphic factors","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Measure edaphic factors"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"574528","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"4FD0442099C94BB59A3804650E73DE70","previous_guid":"910147C529C549ECAD7924E029EB6EDC","previous_id":"574523","last_modified":"1497471270","components":[{"component_id":"950045","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"1F688D42A58B405C9C6D0A9648937D75","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Will be added<\/p>","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Will be added<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"950046","previous_id":"950045","original_id":"0","guid":"4272413A163C4E358CD6DA995164A4E5","previous_guid":"1F688D42A58B405C9C6D0A9648937D75","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Water quality observation and sampling","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Water quality observation and sampling"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"574531","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"A7B9FEB5DD8B40D1B68D3093E1AB795D","previous_guid":"4FD0442099C94BB59A3804650E73DE70","previous_id":"574528","last_modified":"1497471294","components":[{"component_id":"950051","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"0F4F3E94576C41B8905CDEADCE20A9E3","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"950052","previous_id":"950051","original_id":"0","guid":"80BDB7A8C4B740A48E19BA265814E91E","previous_guid":"0F4F3E94576C41B8905CDEADCE20A9E3","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Water quality observation and sampling","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Water quality observation and sampling"},"is_project":0}]}]}
