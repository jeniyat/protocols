Afternoon testing at least one hour prior to dark cycle onset is best. Testing after \u201clights out\u201d in the vivarium is not appropriate.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\nMixed sex test groups: Males and females should be tested in different test groups after a thorough maze cleaning, preferably on different days.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\nTest order: Test order strongly affects performance in the Y-maze. The experimental groups (as designated in the design) should be randomized in the test order. A confounded experiment results if all animals in one group are tested before all the animals in another group. If multiple cohorts are used, the randomization should extend across all cohorts. The number of animals run on a given day should be standardized as much as possible.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Blinding: To assure lack of bias, the experimental groups of the animals should not be displayed on the animal housing, the lab schedule, or the data sheets. Experimental group can be added to the datasets after completion of the study.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Group housing: The caging used for the study should be standardized and reported with the data. If caging changes (animals separated or dying) this should be reported with the data also. In order to randomize test order when 4-5 mice in the same experimental group are housed together, the mice need to be separated into individual cages prior to starting the study.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Test group size: Because of the short test interval, up to about 20 mice can be run in a 4 h period. Untested mice should be kept in the hall before test is initiated and left in the test room afterward.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Protocol deviations: A log of protocol deviations should accompany the data sets to help evaluate \u201coutliers\u201d in the dataset.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":718287,"guid":"9B81E12040FB11E986938B9681107ACC","previous_id":718286,"previous_guid":"5F1B89C040FB11E986938B9681107ACC","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"20DEC3D986884384B7FAC5D65CCE8DB0","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"8FB3A233F8544040AE941536D6D42AE5","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Protocol:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Setting Up<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.
