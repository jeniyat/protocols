The fruits were collected at 45, 75, 100, 125 and 150 days postanthesis (DPA) (Fig 2). The fruits of 'CH' and 'FC' were commercially mature between 125 DPA and 150 DPA. The flavedo, albedo, SMs and JS of the fruits were carefully dissected [22]. The JS of Huanong Red (HR, red-fleshed), Chandler (QDC, red-fleshed), Hirado Buntan (HB, pink-fleshed), Wubu Red-fleshed (WBH, red-fleshed), Thai (T, pale yellow-fleshed), Kao Pan (KP, pale green-fleshed), Fenghuang (FH, pale green-fleshed) and Acidless (WS, pale green-fleshed) pummelo fruits at full maturity were collected from the National Citrus Breeding Center at Huazhong Agricultural University.

[22] and Lee [34]. The carotenoids were identified by comparing the retention times and the absorption spectra with those of authentic standards and were quantified by peak areas. The peak areas were converted to concentrations by comparisons with the authentic standards of known concentrations measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Authentic carotenoid standards of antheraxanthin, \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, all-<em>trans<\/em>-lutein, all-<em>trans-<\/em>violaxanthin and phytoene were purchased from CaroteNature (Lupsingen, Switzerland), while those of \u03b2-carotene and all-<em>trans<\/em>-lycopene together with standards of limonin and nomilin were purchased from Sigma Co.

[35], 3.0 g of lyophilized powder was extracted with 50 mL of dichloromethane via a FexIKAvarioControl system (IKA-Werke GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Staufen, Germany). The extraction solution was collected and then dried under vacuum in a 5301 concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) after 15 cycles of Soxhlet extraction (approximately 3 h), after which 1 mL of acetonitrile was ultimately added. Prior to the HPLC analysis, 1 mL of sample tissue was filtered through a micropore film filter (0.22 \u00b5m).<\/p>\n<p>With respect to HPLC analyses, the same instrument was used to analyze the carotenoids, while a C<sub>18<\/sub> HPLC column (4.6\u00d7150 mm, 5 \u00b5m, Agilent, USA) was used for limonin and nomilin separation. For quantification, an isocratic elution model was applied with acetonitrile:10% methanol (40:60, v\/v) at an elution speed of 1 mL\/min and an injection volume of 20 \u00b5L (Manners, 2007).

[36].<\/p>\n<p>Authentic standards of IAA, ABA, SA and JA were purchased from OlChemIm (OlChemIm, Olomouc, Czech Republic).<\/p>\n<p>RNA extractions and qRT-PCR analysis<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In accordance with the methods of Gao <em>et al<\/em>. [39], total RNA was extracted and purified from the tissues of pummelo fruits. To avoid genomic DNA contamination, the total RNA was then treated with DNase I at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The concentration and purity of the total RNA were then determined via a spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The transcription levels of <em>CmDXS<\/em> (encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase), <em>CmDXR<\/em> (encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase), <em>CmPSY <\/em>(encoding phytoene synthase),<em> CmPDS <\/em>(encoding phytoene desaturase),<em> CmZISO <\/em>(encoding \u03b6-carotene isomerase),<em> CmZDS <\/em>(encoding \u03b6-carotene desaturase),<em> CmCRTISO <\/em>(encoding carotenoids isomerase),<em> CmLCYb1 <\/em>(encoding lycopene \u03b2-cyclase gene1), <em>CmLCYB2 <\/em>(encoding lycopene \u03b2-cyclase gene2), <em>CmLCYe <\/em>(encoding lycopene\u00a0\u03b5-cyclase gene),<em> CmBCH<\/em> (encoding \u03b2-carotene hydroxylase), <em>CmZEP <\/em>(encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase) and <em>CmNSY<\/em> (encoding neoxanthin synthase) were examined via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The primer sequences of the 8 genes above and of an endogenous control gene (<em>Actin<\/em>) were designed in accordance with the methods of Liu <em>et al. <\/em>[22], while those of <em>CmDXS<\/em>, <em>CmDXR<\/em>, <em>CmPSY<\/em> and <em>CmZISO<\/em>, which are listed in S1 Table, were designed with Primer Premier 5 (Premier, Canada).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverse transcription was performed as described by Liu <em>et al. <\/em>[22], while qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI 7500 Real Time System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in accordance with the methods of Liu <em>et al. <\/em>[22]. For each sample, the expression level of each biological replicate was determined by the mean value of at least three technical replicates. The mean threshold cycle (<em>Ct<\/em>) and the standard deviation (SD) for each sample were obtained in accordance with the methods of Gao <em>et al. <\/em>[39].<\/p>\n<p>Amplification and sequencing of gene alleles<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To amplify the whole coding sequences of the eleven genes identified mainly from the JS of both pummelo fruits, primers were designed in accordance with the methods of Liu <em>et al. <\/em>[22] and Gao <em>et al. <\/em>[39] or via Primer Premier 5; the primers are listed in S2 Table. The whole coding sequences of the <em>CmDXS<\/em> alleles could not be amplified, possibly due to their low expression levels in all fruit tissues. The whole coding sequences of at least 10 clones for each carotenogenesis gene were sequenced from the cDNA mainly from the JS in each pummelo fruit. In particular, with respect to <em>CmPSY<\/em>, <em>CmLCYb1<\/em>,<em> CmLCYb2<\/em>,<em> CmLYCe <\/em>and <em>CmNSY<\/em>, nearly 50 clones of each gene in each pummelo fruit were obtained.
