We have tried using rhodamine labelled plasmids to demonstrate this but the results were inconclusive due to issues with cellular autofluorescence.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We have also tried this method with a variety of expression plasmids\u00a0encoding different promoters. For example, we tried the MOE promoter from\u00a0<em>Perkinsus<\/em> <em>marinus\u00a0<\/em>(a closely related species) and the generic eukaryotic CMV promoter. However no GFP fluorescence was detected in these samples.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We have also tried transforming\u00a0<em>in vitro<\/em> synthesized GFP encoding mRNA using this protocol. As of yet, no GFP production has been detected, but this may reflect non-cannonical translational systems in dinoflagellates as the same mRNA could be translated in starfish embryos.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Although the development of expression systems in dinoflagellates remains a challenge, our results suggest that\u00a0<em>O. marina<\/em> may be amenable to genetic
