Place the DNA in an appropriate volume of 1XTE (if EDTA is a problem use 0.1XTE), allowing it to detach from the pasteur pipette\/Gilson tip.  The yield should be >1mg per gram of starting material.  Place at 4 degC. The DNA may take a long time (hours\/days to dissolve properly)."},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1074128","previous_id":"1074127","original_id":"0","guid":"41DAC57C3031493CB8E0668F060117C8","previous_guid":"09EA6FDAC7854314A4708447AFCDC01D","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"615383","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"04095C6A1A44445592CB64676E43A69B","previous_guid":"89273F1B47A54F8C8D264504236EC348","previous_id":"615382","last_modified":"1521433713","components":[{"component_id":"1074129","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"010B234B582244869470E0160A67768F","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"15.
