A significant obstacle in adopting long-read technology for viral metagenomics lies in obtaining the amount of DNA required; e.g. viral DNA extraction from 20 L of seawater yields far less than the micrograms of DNA recommended for efficient long-read sequencing. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Long-Read Linker-Amplified Shotgun Library approach for long-read viral metagenomics. The VirION method has been demonstrated to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods, and analyses that combined VirION long-read data with Illumina, short-read data, captured many abundant and ubiquitous viral genomes that were missed by short-read assemblies. This approach was also shown to have overcome issues of microdiversity, and to have captured more genomic islands than short-read assemblies. Thus, VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p><strong>Sample requirements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&lt;1 \u03bcg of viral metagenomic DNA in 47 \u03bcl of elution buffer (EB) (e.g.\u00a010 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) or nuclease free water (NFW)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Important note: EDTA compromises flow cell pores, so do not use TE to re-suspend\/elute viral DNA; If viruses were obtained by chemical flocculation and resuspension, further cleaning (post DNA extraction with Wizard DNA Clean-Up System) may be required (e.g. using\u00a0DNeasy PowerClean Pro Kit (Cat No.\/ID:\u00a012997-50).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stopping stages<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If pausing (e.g. overnight) either after PCR adapter ligation and clean-up (Stage \u2018C\u2019) or after amplification and clean-up (Stage \u2018D\u2019), some reagents will not be required immediately: check protocol to ensure reagents are not defrosted unnecessarily.
