LNA-<em>in situ<\/em> hybridization (ISH) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.exiqon.com\/mirna-ish-kit\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.exiqon.com\/mirna-ish-kit<\/a>). Sections of FFPE tissues of human OPLL and null mice (4-\u00b5m-thick) were fixed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (3 \u00d7 5 min), treated with 0.5 % Triton X-100 (10 min at 4 \u00b0\u0421), and briefly washed with PBS followed by two washes (10 min each) in saline-sodium citrate buffer (2\u00d7 SSC, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M Na<sub>3<\/sub>\u0421<sub>6<\/sub>\u041d<sub>5<\/sub>\u041e<sub>7<\/sub>, \u0440\u041d 7.0). The sections were then digested with 15 \u03bcg\/mL proteinase K (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min and rinsed for 3 \u00d7 5 min in PBS. Hybridization was performed in a humid chamber for 18 h at 65 \u00b0C. <em>In situ<\/em> hybridization of miR-340 was conducted using a miRCURY LNA microRNA ISH Optimization kit (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). miR-340-Alexa Fluor 488 and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Alexa Fluor 555) were detected in human OPLL tissue by <em>in situ <\/em>hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. After staining, the tissues were observed by fluorescence microscopy (BZ-X700, Keyence, Osaka, Japan).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8201","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1507717009","protocol_affiliation":"Clinical Proteomics and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan","affiliation":"Kurume University, Clinical Proteomics and Gene Therapy","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.j9hcr36","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"MichiyoTsuru-y2u284x2u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/pcvhyjn.jpg","full_name":"Michiyo Tsuru","created_by":"Michiyo Tsuru","private_link":"9FDB531200C4CEA60A6E92A66164EA9A","original_img":"1","username":"michiyo-tsuru","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0196204","manuscript_citation":"Tsuru M,  Ono A,  Umeyama H,  Takeuchi M,  Nagata K (2018) Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of CXCL7 leads to posterior longitudinal ligament ossification.
