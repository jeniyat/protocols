females may dominate the competition by their larger size (increased filtering ability) and by retaining food particles within their guts to extract a larger fraction of their nutrients.\u00a0 Pupal mass for both sexes is primarily affected by food\/larva; density affects the pupal mass through competition and the total food\/vial (the interaction between food and density) and this interaction is different for the two sexes.\u00a0 Age at pupation is more affected by density than by food\/larva and the interaction between food and density also differs across the two sexes for this variable.\u00a0 The nature of competition between and within the sexes at various food levels and densities is described.\u00a0 The implications of this complex response to food level and density among larvae on the ecology of this species is considered.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"15478","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1536524590","protocol_affiliation":"retired","affiliation":"retired","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.tcweixe","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"KurtSteinwascher-w2t264v2s2y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png","full_name":"Kurt Steinwascher","created_by":"Kurt Steinwascher","private_link":"A16677E0F08D1A29247CAB46E63968BC","original_img":"1","username":"kurt-steinwascher","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":353643,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Aedes aegypti, age at pupation, ANOVA, competition, exploitative, female advantage, filter feeding, food x density, growth rate, interference, larval density, larval development, life history, MANOVA, multivariate analysis of variance, pupal mass, pupation, sex ratio, size distribution, survival","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Kurt Steinwascher","authors_list":[{"name":"Kurt Steinwascher","affiliation":"retired","username":"kurt-steinwascher","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png","username":"kurt-steinwascher","full_name":"Kurt Steinwascher","created_by":"Kurt Steinwascher"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"<p>It is easier to create a standardized solution of baker's yeast and dilute it down to the concentration necessary to add the calculated total mg per vial for each treatment. \u00a0However, the yeast must be completely dissolved in the solution and it must be repeatedly stirred to keep it from clumping or settling.<\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"661965","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"2C6C794B490C413A98830889441EEA7C","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1536527645","components":[{"component_id":"1193827","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"C93E35315EFC475A9A8FCE4060E82907","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"For experiment 1:  Obtain mosquito eggs from an  A. aegypti colony after feeding females on a mouse.
