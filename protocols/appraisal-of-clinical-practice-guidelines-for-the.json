Appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for the management of<br \/>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using the AGREE II Instrument: a systematic review.<br \/>PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017078712 Available from:<br \/>http:\/\/www.crd.york.ac.uk\/PROSPERO\/display_record.php?ID=CRD42017078712<br \/>Review question<br \/>The aim is to explore the quality of and critically appraise recently published evidence-based clinical practice<br \/>guidelines for the management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<br \/>Searches<br \/>Data Sources include:-<br \/>\u2022 Guidelines International Network http:\/\/www.g-i-n.net\/library\/international-guidelines-library<br \/>\u2022 National Guidelines Clearinghouse http:\/\/www.guidelines.gov<br \/>\u2022 EBSCO - DynaMed Plus https:\/\/dynamed.ebscohost.com\/<br \/>\u2022 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence http:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/<br \/>\u2022 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network http:\/\/www.sign.ac.uk\/index.html<br \/>\u2022 US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health (MEDLINE\/ PubMed)<br \/>http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/PubMed (for CPGs published as full-text articles)<br \/>\u2022 Google Scholar (free) http:\/\/scholar.google.com\/ (for CPGs published as full-text articles) \u2022 Plus CPGs<br \/>published by national and international specialized scientific societies\/ associations relevant to ADHD (e.g.<br \/>American Academy of Pediatrics, American Psychiatric Association, European Psychiatric Association, etc.).<br \/>Additionally, we will also conduct internet searches for CPGs published online only.<br \/>Types of study to be included<br \/>Clinical Practice Guidelines<br \/>Condition or domain being studied<br \/>ADHD in children and adolescents. The inclusion or exclusion of adults will have been at the discretion of the<br \/>Source CPG developers and age limits, co-morbidities, etc, should have been defined by them. We will<br \/>assess how this was reported as part of our appraisal using the AGREE II Instrument.<br \/>Participants\/population<br \/>The participants, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, should have been specified by the guideline<br \/>developers and cannot be known until we begin the appraisal of the guidelines identified by our searches.<br \/>We will include only CPGs with a section targeting children and adolescents. Relevant items of the AGREE II<br \/>Instrument will be used to assess how well the scope of the CPG was reported.<br \/>Intervention(s), exposure(s)<br \/>The interventions included within the included CPGs will have been pre-defined by the CPG development<br \/>group to match the individual requirements within the scope. We will only consider CPGs that include the<br \/>comprehensive management of ADHD. The criteria of the AGREE II Instrument will be used to assess how<br \/>well the included interventions were reported and presented. Identified key target interventions include<br \/>diagnosis and assessment (i.e. parent, carer, teacher, or patient complaints, history and physical\u00a0examination, psychological tools, differential diagnosis, and investigations) and treatment (i.e. psychosocial<br \/>interventions, pharmacological treatment, comorbidities, parents\/ carers and home, monitoring, special<br \/>cases, transition of care from childhood to adulthood, complementary medicine, and treatment of<br \/>complications of pharmacological treatment)<br \/>Comparator(s)\/control<br \/>Comparator(s) and control groups with inclusion and exclusion criteria may or may not have been predefined<br \/>by the CPG development group. Comparators would not usually be defined when multiple<br \/>interventions are included in the recommendations of the CPG.<br \/>Primary outcome(s)<br \/>(1) Standardize evidence-based assessment and management of ADHD including Early diagnosis and<br \/>intervention of ADHD and Multi-modal interventions for ADHD.<br \/>(2) Improve patient target outcomes and safety (e.g. symptoms of ADHD, academic performance, social<br \/>relationships, parent-child interactions and family stress, and risk for serious accidental injury)<br \/>Secondary outcome(s)<br \/>(1) Decrease variation of practice.<br \/>(2) Improve patient-related adverse health outcomes that co-occur with ADHD (e.g. substance abuse<br \/>disorder and smoking, sleep difficulties\/disorders, physical injuries, etc.)<br \/>Data extraction (selection and coding)<br \/>Five reviewers including one CPG methodologist will independently screen the titles and abstracts of all<br \/>searched documents and determine the ones for full-text review and eligible CPGs for ADHD.<br \/>Disagreements will be resolved through discussion and consensus with the reviewers. The same five<br \/>reviewers will search the internet for CPGs published online only. Information relevant to rating of each of the<br \/>23 items on the AGREE II Instrument will be extracted from included CPGs by utilizing the online tool (MY<br \/>AGREE Plus) that is freely available and accessible from the AGREE Enterprise website<br \/>(http:\/\/www.agreetrust.org\/). The authors will then independently score every item on a 1-7 scale based on<br \/>how well each CPG addresses the listed questions and the AGREE criteria. An additional validation of the<br \/>included CPGs will be conducted for inclusion of systematic reviews in the evidence-based with their<br \/>category whether Cochrane systematic reviews or others.<br \/>Risk of bias (quality) assessment<br \/>The AGREE II Instrument addresses the reporting of CPGs. It does not assess aspects of study design<br \/>quality such as appropriateness of the methods used or trustworthiness of the recommendations. We are not<br \/>aware of any validated instrument for assessing risk of bias of CPGs. Some of the items on the AGREE II<br \/>checklist are relevant to the detection of potential sources of bias (e.g. bias due to under-representation of<br \/>some stakeholders in the development process - items 4 and 5, reporting bias - items 9-12, bias due to<br \/>conflict of interest\/independence of funding bodies - items 22 and 23).<br \/>Strategy for data synthesis<br \/>Descriptive statistics will be generated and presented in tabular format to summarize the characteristics of<br \/>the CPGs eligible for inclusion. Once all seven AGREE appraisers have scored each item on the AGREE II,<br \/>they will hold a meeting to discuss discrepancies between scores and address any obvious discrepancies<br \/>and errors. For every included CPG, we will use the 'My AGREE PLUS' (http:\/\/www.agreetrust.org\/myagree\/)<br \/>to record scores and to keep online records of individual appraiser's scores. For every single CPG, a<br \/>standardized quality score will be calculated for each of the six domains of the AGREE II Instrument, using<br \/>the equation presented in the AGREE II User\u2019s Manual. In summary, standardized domain scores will be<br \/>calculated by summing up all the appraisers\u2019 scores of the individual items in a domain and by scaling the<br \/>total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain. This calculation is automatically<br \/>generated on the My AGREE PLUS platform. The overall quality of the included CPGs in each domain of the<br \/>AGREE II will be presented through the two overall assessments included in the instrument. Since the six<br \/>domains of the AGREE II are independent, standardized domain quality scores will not be aggregated.<\/p>\n<p>Analysis of subgroups or subsets<br \/>The references section of included CPGs will be reviewed and assessed for inclusion of 'Systematic<br \/>Reviews' in the evidence-base of these CPGs (especially the Cochrane systematic reviews).<br \/>Contact details for further information<br \/>Dr. Yasser Sami Amer<br \/>yasser3amer@yahoo.com<br \/>Organisational affiliation of the review<br \/>The Saudi ADHD Society, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia<br \/>http:\/\/adhd.org.sa\/en\/<br \/>Review team members and their organisational affiliations<br \/>Dr Turki Albatti.
