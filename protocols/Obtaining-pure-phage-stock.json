Little is still known about the occurrence and diversity of phages infecting specific hosts, but generally isolation procedures as those described above may reveal multiple phages against specific target bacteria (e.g., Comeau et al. 2006; Holmfeldt et al. 2007; Stenholm et al. 2008). It is therefore necessary to further isolate the phages to obtain specific stocks of single phages.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"1492","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1441052262","protocol_affiliation":"Manual of Aquatic Viral Ecology","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.dpu5nv","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2v2b433v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","full_name":"Amy Chan","created_by":"Amy Chan","private_link":"630483E25F396E3B04D7EF2E0CEBA24E","original_img":"1","username":"amy-chan","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":222861,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"45","group_uri":"verve-net","group_name":"VERVE Net","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/cdqcwwe.png","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"},{"group_id":"81","group_uri":"suttle-laboratory-of-marine-molecular-microbiology","group_name":"Suttle Laboratory of Marine Molecular Microbiology and Virology","group_logo":"","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[{"protocol_name":"Isolation and life cycle characterization of lytic viruses infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria","protocol_name_html":"Isolation and life cycle characterization of lytic viruses infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria","uri":"Isolation-and-life-cycle-characterization-of-lytic-dxq7mv","username":"amy-chan","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","full_name":"Amy Chan"}],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Mathias Middelboe, Amy M.
