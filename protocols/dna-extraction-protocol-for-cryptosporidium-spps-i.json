The kit uses a high pure specially-treated silica-based material fixed into a column to efficiently bind DNA in the presence of high salt. The kit applies the principle of a minicolumn spin technology and the use of optimized buffers to ensure that only DNA is isolated while cellular protein, humic acid, metabolites, salts and other low molecular weight impurities are removed during the subsequent washing steps. We used this protocol for <em>Cryptosporidium<\/em> spp DNA extraction from stool samples with minor modifications and its working.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>Pre-set the water bath at 70<sup>o<\/sup>C.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"3116","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Centrifuges 5810 R","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"https:\/\/online-shop.eppendorf.us\/US-en\/Centrifugation-44533\/Centrifuges-44534\/Centrifuge-5810-5810R-PF-18809.html","reagent_vendor_id":"49","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.eppendorf.com\/int\/index.php?action=centrifuge","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Eppendorf Centrifuge","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"42337","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Micropipetes tips","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"127365","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"GF-1 Soil sample DNA extraction Kit","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"GF-SD-025","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"390","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.vivantechnologies.com","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Vivantis Technologies Sdn.
