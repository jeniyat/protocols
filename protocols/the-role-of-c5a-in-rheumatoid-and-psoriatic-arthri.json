Blockade of C5a or its receptor (C5aR) is efficacious in several arthritis models. The aim of this study\u00a0is to investigate the role of C5a and C5aR in human rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \u2013 both with respect to expression and function.<\/p>\n<p>Synovial fluid, blood and synovial samples will be\u00a0obtained from rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis patients as a less inflammatory arthritis type, and blood from healthy subjects. Cells infiltrating synovial tissue\u00a0will analysed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. SF and blood will\u00a0be analysed for biomarkers by flow cytometry or ELISA. The effect of a blocking anti-human C5aR mAb on leukocyte migration\u00a0will be determined using a Boyden chamber. Appropriate statistical tests will be applied for comparisons.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8599","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1509964260","protocol_affiliation":"the Parker Institute, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kmxcu7n","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2v2a4v2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/014.png","full_name":"Else Marie Bartels","created_by":"Else Marie Bartels","private_link":"CB365B47A8F6EEB9F58F92ED5A9E7A74","original_img":"1","username":"else-marie-bartels","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0189017","manuscript_citation":"Hornum L,  Hansen AJ,  Tornehave D,  Fjording MS,  Colmenero P,  W\u00e4tjen IF,  Nielsen NHS,  Bliddal H,  Bartels EM, C5a and C5aR are elevated in joints of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis patients, and C5aR blockade attenuates leukocyte migration to synovial fluid.
