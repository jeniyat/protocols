To increase the detection limit, several different VCs can be combined and added to the same culture. Another convenient way to screen larger sample volumes is to perform liquid enrichment cultures (Suttle 1993). By this approach, larger volumes of water samples can be screened for cyanophages, thus enabling detection of \u0080\u009crare\u0080\u009d viruses. Similar to the use of enrichment cultures for bacteriophages, the disadvantages include the fact that lysis of the host cells are not always obvious, especially if the initial titer is low or if the host culture is not clonal or unialgal. Also, more steps are required to dilute out nonreplicating viruses to obtain pure clonal isolates. Because it is an end-point dilution assay, only the most abundant phages will be isolated. The principle is the same as for the isolation of bacteriophages mentioned earlier except that the sample volumes screened are in the order of liters instead of milliliters.","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"131371","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"3E213879C0AB4A54961367ACEB9B6F73","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1502718622","components":[{"component_id":"974862","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"D3CD1A1DC03241C7BA46ED4B1546C88D","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":null,"order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":null},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"126851","previous_id":"974862","original_id":"0","guid":"1C44954B290744768CA6F0419FF8C645","previous_guid":"D3CD1A1DC03241C7BA46ED4B1546C88D","component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"Prefilter
