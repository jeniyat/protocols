(1994) and were described recently in detail by Prangishvili (2006). These methods consist of enrichment cultures followed by host isolation and screening for virus production in both these isolates and enrichment cultures. These techniques are very similar to those used for bacteriophages, with the major exception being the extreme growth conditions (80\u02daC, pH 3).<br \/><br \/>This is a protocol from:&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Stedman,&nbsp;K.
