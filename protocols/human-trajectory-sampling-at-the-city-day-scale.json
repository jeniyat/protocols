The goal is to obtain a representative sample of the space-time paths that exist in a given city. Sampling points and times are choosen and then used to recruit participants. If participants consent to be part of the study, they (1) respond anonymously to a survey about their activity-spaces, and\/or (2) use a mobile phone application to track themselves during a 1-week period and share their anonymized trajectory information with the research team.\u00a0This\u00a0protocol has been developed\u00a0thanks to funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No 657956.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"<p>This protocol involves recruiting volunteers at points and times selected randomly throughout a city.
