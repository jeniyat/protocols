In the approach described here, sets of about 50 short oligonucleotides, each labeled with a single fluorophore, are hybridized to target mRNAs in tissue sections. Each set binds to a single mRNA molecule and can be detected by fluorescence microscopy as a diffraction-limited spot. Tissue architecture is then assessed by counterstaining the sections with DNA\u00a0dye (DAPI), and cell borders can be visualized with a dye-coupled antibody. Spots are detected automatically with custom-made software, which we make freely available. The mRNA molecules thus detected are assigned to single cells within a tissue semiautomatically by using a graphical user interface developed in our laboratory. In this protocol, we describe an example of quantitative analysis of mRNA levels and localization in mouse small intestine. The procedure (from tissue dissection to obtaining data sets) takes 3 d. Data analysis will require an additional 3\u20137 d, depending on the type of analysis.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p><strong>REAGENT SETUP<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Definition of the target sequence\u00a0<\/strong>Choose\u00a0a region of the target mRNA that is sufficiently long so that at least 20 probes\u2014but preferably 48\u2014each 20 bp long, can anneal to it, with at least two bases present between neighboring probe-binding sites (which amounts to at least 1,054 bp). If possible, avoid using untranslated regions (UTRs).<strong>\u00a0\u0394<\/strong><strong>CRITICAL<\/strong>The presence of multiple binding sites for some of the probes in the library (other than the mRNA of interest) will lead to a high fluorescent background, which will decrease the quality of the FISH signal and may cause problems in spot detection and data analysis. If possible, exclude tandem repeats, microsatellites and other repeating sequences from the target sequence.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design of the library of probe oligonucleotides\u00a0<\/strong>Use\u00a0the Probe Designer tool (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biosearchtech.com\/stellarisdesigner\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.biosearchtech.com\/stellarisdesigner\/<\/a>) developed by Arjun Raj for this task. This tool is freely available, and no downloads are required; users only need to create their own login name and password, and then they can start using the Probe Designer immediately and free of charge. Follow stepwise instructions to upload the target sequence, to enter the information on the origin of the sequence, to specify the masking level and to create the list of oligonucleotide probes. Order the oligonucleotides on the list from Biosearch Technologies or another company of your choice. Please make sure to order sufficient quantities of the oligonucleotides in the most convenient format. In this protocol (probe-fluorophore coupling procedure, Steps 1\u20134), we use 10 \u03bcl of each oligonucleotide at the concentration of 100 \u03bcM (in water) per labeling reaction. In general, DNA oligonucleotides dissolved in water are stable for several years if they are stored below \u221220 \u00b0C. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles do not detectably affect the performance of our libraries in this method. However, please consider the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for reconstitution and storage of the oligos.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sodium bicarbonate, 1 M, pH 8.0\u00a0<\/strong>In a 50-ml Falcon tube, dissolve 4.2 g of the powder in 40 ml of distilled or deionized, nuclease-free water.

The absolute numbers obtained by our technique are in a close correspondence to those measured by different means, for instance, via quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)1,2. As few as one mRNA molecule per cell can be detected. The maximum number of individual molecules that can be resolved microscopically is of the order of several thousand. This upper limit is dictated by the ratio between the cell volume and the typical voxel taken by a diffraction-limited mRNA dot (~0.2 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 0.3 \u03bcm).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Three different mRNA species can be simultaneously visualized (using probe libraries differentially labeled with Cy5, Alexa Fluor 594 and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)) and quantified in parallel by implementing the present protocol; this upper limit is determined by the number of different fluorophores that can be spectrally resolved. Simultaneous staining with a DNA-binding dye and an antibody against cell-cell adhesion proteins enables the visualization of cell nuclei and borders,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">which is a requirement when the aims are to assign mRNA spots to cells within intact tissue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As an example of quantitative and spatial analysis of gene expression, here we use the crypt of Lieberk\u00fchn, a functional unit of the intestinal epithelium, as a target tissue. First, the numbers of diffraction-limited spots are automatically detected using algorithms previously developed in our laboratory2,3. Next, cells are manually segmented on the basis of DAPI nuclear staining and E-cadherin lateral membrane staining, and spots are then assigned to individual cells. The resulting single-cell gene-expression profiles can be presented as a spatial profile (<strong>Fig. 1<\/strong>), which we termed \u2018cryptogram\u2019, from \u2018crypt\u2019 and \u2018histogram\u2019. This approach enables the experimenter to assess the precise spatial location of the expression of genes of interest in multiple crypts in the tissue of interest3 (<strong>Fig. 1h<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rphfw26.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"480\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rphfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 1.56.14 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the intestine3\u20136, the three-color smFISH protocol can be applied to a variety of tissues, including mammary glands7, kidney8, stomach, lymph nodes, mouse embryos at different gestational stages, human breast tumors9 and possibly many more. Although the quality of FISH signal is consistently high in the different tissues tested, autofluorescence and\/or nonspecific probe binding may emerge in some tissues, and it may need to be addressed if it interferes with spot detection and\/or data analysis. Examples of tissues that we have found to be particularly high in autofluorescence are skin (especially hair shafts and cornified layers of epidermis; A.L., unpublished observation), stomach (parietal cells contain highly autofluorescent cytoplasmic vesicles; A.L., unpublished observation) and small intestine (Paneth cells with highly autofluorescent cytoplasmic granules3). smFISH can also be combined with other techniques, such as EdU staining4, immunofluorescence4 and DNA FISH9 for probing single cells in intact tissues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given that hybridization conditions for different probe sets are similar, this method has great potential for the simultaneous detection of several mRNA species. As mentioned, the number of mRNA species to be detected simultaneously is limited by the availability of fluorophores that can be spectrally resolved using current technology. We routinely detect three different transcripts at the same time, using Cy5, Alexa Fluor 594 and TMR fluorophores. Other fluorophores emitting light at different wavelengths can be used as well, thus increasing the number of mRNAs that can be simultaneously detected10. Furthermore, combinatorial labeling, in which different probe subsets are coupled to different fluorophores, can further increase the number of different color combinations that can be computationally resolved10,11. This approach may enable truly multiplexed single-molecule mRNA imaging, which would greatly facilitate large-scale gene expression profiling in single cells, in the context of tissues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cell border detection (segmentation) may become a challenge in tissues for which no good antibody against cell membrane\u2013 associated proteins is available. In these cases, cell borders may be visualized by other means, such as by using fluorescently labeled phalloidin or GFP-fusion membrane-associated proteins. An example of the latter is the use of tissues from a knock-in mouse expressing E-cadherin fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)12. Alternatively, when cell border labeling is impossible, too laborious or not crucial, tissue surface can be divided into arbitrary (virtual) sectors (\u2018cell proxies\u2019) and mRNA spots can be assigned to these proxies instead of cells. After the segmentation step, spatial analysis of mRNA distributions can be performed according to the topological features of the tissue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to tissue sections, our protocol can be applied to whole-mount organs or embryos with no substantial modifications. The only challenging part of such an application is imaging depth, as the smFISH signal quality from parts lying deeper than 10 \u03bcm below the objective will decrease substantially. This problem can be alleviated by using confocal microscopy. The best results so far are obtained on a spinning-disk microscope (quantifiable signal from tissue layers 30\u201350 \u03bcm deep tissue).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpifw26.png\" width=\"579\" height=\"333\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpifw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 1.59.36 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpjfw26.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"222\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpjfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 1.59.52 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Experimental design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oligonucleotide libraries are designed in agreement with the set of requirements established previously2, and then purchased. By the term \u2018library\u2019, we mean a set of oligonucleotides, each of which hybridizes to the same mRNA molecule. The \u2018collective\u2019 binding of singly labeled oligonucleotides to the target mRNA molecule results in the appearance of a single bright fluorescent spot. A typical library consists of 48 oligonucleotides, each 20 bp long. The number of oligonucleotides in a library should exceed 20 (ref. 2), and it often is as large as 96.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The minimum size of a library depends on the length of the target mRNA. This target molecule should be sufficiently long to accommodate at least 20 oligonucleotides, plus a two-base space between neighboring oligonucleotides. Other important parameters are the G-C content of the library, which should be as close to 45% as possible, and the uniqueness of the target sequence (to minimize binding of the probes to anything other than the target mRNA). Conveniently, the \u2018Probe Designer\u2019 tool (freely available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biosearchtech.com\/stellarisdesigner\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.biosearchtech.com\/stellarisdesigner\/<\/a>) will guide a user through probe design, taking all the important parameters into consideration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 3\u2032-end of each library oligonucleotide is coupled to a single fluorophore (Steps 1\u20135), and the resulting labeled oligonucleotide is purified (Steps 6\u201310). Alternatively, the sets of fluorophore-coupled and purified oligonucleotides can be purchased from Biosearch Technologies under the brand name Stellaris, or from another company of choice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tissue is dissected right after euthanizing the animal, and it is immediately fixed (Steps 12\u201316). After a cryoprotection step (Step 16), frozen blocks are prepared (Steps 17\u201320). Cryosections of 5\u201310-\u03bcm thickness are mounted onto cleaned and poly-l-lysine\u2013coated glass coverslips (Steps 21\u201326). The attached sections are fixed again, rinsed and permeabilized (Steps 24\u201326), and then rehydrated and hybridized with the probes and antibody overnight (Steps 30\u201332). An antibody can be used to stain the cell borders, so as to visualize tissue structure. However, if hybridization conditions are not optimal for staining with the necessary antibody, alternative counterstaining methods should be considered, such as staining with fluorescently labeled phalloidin (Step 35). After hybridization, sections on coverslips are washed, counterstained with nuclear dye and equilibrated with the imaging buffer. If phalloidin staining is chosen to visualize the cell border, this staining is performed at this point, and sections are subsequently rinsed and mounted (Steps 33\u201336).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Images are acquired using an inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with an automated stage, a cooled back-illumined charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a \u00d7100 oil-immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 (Steps 37\u201339). At each position, a 5\u201310-\u03bcm-thick <em>z<\/em>-stack of images with 0.2\u20130.4 \u03bcm of distance between individual planes is acquired in order to collect the information from the whole thickness of the section.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The data are analyzed using MATLAB software (Steps 40\u201342). This software enables the automatic detection of the mRNA molecule spots, assists in manually segmenting cell borders and assigns the spots to individual cells, labeled according to position within the tissue relative to a reference (for instance, the bottom of an intestinal crypt). All automated and manual steps are integrated into ImageM, a straightforward and user-friendly GUI developed in our lab (<strong>Box 1 <\/strong>and <strong>Figs. 2 <\/strong>and <strong>3<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpkfw26.png\" width=\"287\" height=\"171\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpkfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 2.03.04 PM.png\" \/><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpmfw26.png\" width=\"275\" height=\"110\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpmfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 2.03.17 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rppfw26.png\" width=\"346\" height=\"202\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpnfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 2.05.55 PM.png\" \/><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpqfw26.png\" width=\"212\" height=\"121\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/rpqfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-21 at 2.06.12 PM.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Key analysis of the gene expression signatures created can include spatial mapping of gene expression, single-cell gene expression profiles and single-cell correlations of pairs of genes3. In intestinal\u00a0crypts, the position of cells above the crypt apex defines a natural one-dimensional axis. For each gene, a spatial gene expression profile can be created. Pooling profiles from different analyzed crypts enables one to obtain the average gene expression profile and its variance, which we term a cryptogram (<strong>Fig. 1g,h<\/strong>). Such an analysis is particularly suited to genes broadly expressed in a consistent manner between crypts. Separate analysis can be applied to other genes that show a more variable expression pattern in terms of the position of the expressing cells along the crypt axis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the mouse intestine, some genes are highly specific to particular differentiated cell types, which can appear in variable positions in different crypts. Examples include markers for Goblet cells (<em>Clca3<\/em>) and Tuft cells (<em>Dclk1<\/em>, also known as <em>Dcamkl1<\/em>)3. An additional analysis, which can be performed using smFISH on tissue sections, is the characterization of single-cell gene expression signatures for such rarer cell types. The numbers of transcripts of other genes in such cells, defined by a marker of interest, can be compared to cells, which are directly above or below the cell of interest. This analysis stringently tests the upregulation or downregulation of particular genes in the cell type of interest, while controlling the spatial pattern of gene expression of the tested genes3. In addition, the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients of\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">the single-cell gene expression, correlated transcription patterns of pairs of genes may indicate the presence of common regulatory modules for these genes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More advanced and sophisticated analyses can be performed on the resulting data sets. MATLAB codes are available upon request (see MATERIALS).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, please note that although positive and\/or negative controls for the expression of specific mRNAs are not covered in the procedure detailed below their use is likely to greatly improve the reliability of the protocol\u2019s results. A more in-depth discussion on this subject is reported in the ANTICIPATED RESULTS (Step 42).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>TROUBLESHOOTING\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<table style=\"height: 235px; width: 649px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 20px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48px; height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step\u00a0<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 159px; height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>Problem\u00a0<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 211px; height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>Possible reason\u00a0<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 215px; height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>Solution\u00a0<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 164px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48px; height: 164px; text-align: justify;\">25-35<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 159px; height: 164px; text-align: left;\">Tissue sections detach from the glass<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 211px; height: 164px; text-align: left;\">Insufficient cleaning and\/or coating of the coverslips<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 215px; height: 164px; text-align: left;\">Increase the length of coverslip sonication in detergent and ethanol to 20 min or add a second sonication step in ethanol.

For example, to couple five libraries of 48 oligos to Cy5, add 150 \u03bcl of buffer to the dry dye, resuspend it and use 30 \u03bcl per library reaction (each library in a separate tube). To couple ten separate 48-oligo libraries to Alexa Fluor 594, resuspend the dye in 300 \u03bcl of buffer and use 30 \u03bcl per reaction. To couple a larger library, the quantity of dye needs to be increased. For example, a 96-oligonucleotide library will need 60 \u03bcl of the dye solution. In the present experiment, <em>Ki67 <\/em>library requires 60 \u03bcl of the Alexa Fluor 594 solution, and the <em>Wipi1 <\/em>library requires 30 \u03bcl of the Cy5 solution.<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1035479","previous_id":"1035474","original_id":"0","guid":"FFFE436593BB47E6B44E046623186AA0","previous_guid":"9847CE7A7F3F41B8867E74D973165626","component_type_id":"26","data_id":"17002","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Note","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"26","source_data":{"annotation_id":"17002","thread_id":"17002","id":"17002","thread_title":"Comment on step 3 of Single-molecule mRNA detection and counting in mammalian tissue","uri":"comment-on-step-3-of-singlemolecule-mrna-detection","thread_uri":"comment-on-step-3-of-singlemolecule-mrna-detection","step_id":"600169","protocol_uri":"single-molecule-mrna-detection-and-counting-in-mam-mc7c2zn","protocol_name":"Single-molecule mRNA detection and counting in mammalian tissue","protocol_name_html":"Single-molecule mRNA detection and counting in mammalian tissue","annotation":"<p><strong>CRITICAL STEP\u00a0<\/strong>Once they have dissolved, the dyes quickly lose reactivity, so please proceed to Step 5 of the PROCEDURE quickly.
