methods, hence the name Frankenstein. Developed to prepare nuclei isolates from small sample sizes (as little as a grain of rice), this protocol uses FACS to identify cell subpopulations based on ploidy (e.g. tumor versus stroma), to ensure that nuclei suspensions are not clumped, and to remove any debris, especially ambient RNA, to help reduce background. The reference protocols can be found in the following papers: Hu, et al., Habib, et al. (2016), Habib, et al.
