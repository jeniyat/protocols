Only roots of the same plant will be mixed together here. Place the field name and the plant number on the label on the sack for roots collected from each plant on a field. Sacks will thus have the field name and the plant number on them (see Table 2). If you can manage to label the sampled roots in the field then one sack per field sampled is also possible to use here. Just make sure that the labels placed on the roots cannot fall off. Labelling cassava roots in the field may be challenging, but labelling can also be done in the lab during HCN analysis (see Table 2).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">If you have an interest in knowing the HCN levels of each root sampled, i.e. the HCN content of roots between plants and within plants, this will affect your labelling. Each root sampled should have the field number, plant number and root number (Table 3). All roots can be packed in one sack in the field as full labelling will have to be carried out right in the field. You will have to find a reliable labelling option that does not involve damaging the roots. <\/li><\/ol><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bduna.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bdupa.png\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bduqa.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"429CB3E43C0A4243B20CF74213125660","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bduna.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"4DA8AD34066A43B5B038574ECD8A86C3","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bdupa.png\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054727,"guid":"A969B4F8A19848E2A877D727BD34288A","order_id":4,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bduqa.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":711100,"guid":"71C67D1035BF11E980FC9FABE6308E69","previous_id":711092,"previous_guid":"BB9EC8A035BC11E980FC9FABE6308E69","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"1EB5A098381E4C27821D8D5BAA354990","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Sample storage while in the field"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"5395B6B84D1F453F9CA3776BE35F5D29","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Once the roots are packed they must be quickly returned to the lab to begin cyanide analysis. If you will have to delay due to the number of samples to be collected or due to the distance to the laboratory, then place the sampled roots in a cool place right after harvest while in the field. This can be under the shade of some trees. Also keep the roots cool during their transportation. This is one reason for using polypropylene sacks, as they allow the cassava roots to still breathe and to stay cool, thus delaying deterioration. Never sample too many roots at a time as cyanide determination should be done at most within 6 - 12 hours after roots are harvested. Roots can rapidly deteriorate and have their composition changed. Beginning HCN analysis as soon as possible is hence essential for obtaining representative results (yes, even if it means a sleepless night). The state of the roots should be as close as possible to the state they were in right at harvest. Time spent in the field should thus take this factor into consideration. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":711101,"guid":"82B9C87035BF11E980FC9FABE6308E69","previous_id":711100,"previous_guid":"71C67D1035BF11E980FC9FABE6308E69","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6C1255E0C36C4E4E98A9C3B2DEEAA923","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Sample storage before HCN analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"2FA18BADD394487B99F9E05276C17D81","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">It may not be always possible to immediately analyse all roots or any of the roots.

Some researchers advise that the middle section of the cassava roots can be cut and packed in an airtight plastic bag and kept frozen in a deep freezer until the time of HCN analysis. Others suggest that root samples should be freeze-dried. Think of the most efficient and cost effective method for the number of samples that you have. Also think of the equipment available.
