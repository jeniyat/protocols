However, the mechanisms of action of DSS remain poorly understood, and<br \/>observations by our laboratory and other groups indicate that DSS contamination of colonic tissues from DSStreated<br \/>mice potently inhibits the quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)<br \/>amplification of mRNA.\u00a0A prior study used poly-A-mediated mRNA purification to remove DSS from RNA extracts, but we herein<br \/>report a second efficient and cost-effective approach to counteract this inhibition, using lithium chloride<br \/>precipitation to entirely remove DSS from RNAs. We also explored how DSS interferes with qRT-PCR process, and<br \/>we report for the first time that DSS can alter the binding of reverse transcriptase to previously primed RNA and<br \/>specifically inhibits the enzymatic activities of reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase in vitro. This likely explains<br \/>why DSS-treated colonic RNA is not suitable to qRT-PCR amplification without a previous purification step.<br \/>In summary, we provide a simple method to remove DSS from colonic RNAs, and we demonstrate for<br \/>the first time that DSS can inhibit the activities of both polymerase and reverse transcriptase. In order to reliably<br \/>analyze gene expression in the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated mice, the efficiency rate of qRT-PCR must be the<br \/>same between all the different experimental groups, including the water-treated control group, suggesting that<br \/>whatever the duration and the percentage of the DSS treatment, RNAs must be purified.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"50944","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"DSS","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":null,"version_class":"8326","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1508427758","protocol_affiliation":"Gerorgia State University","affiliation":"Georgia State University","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kdecs3e","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Emilie-y2u2b4v2y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Emilie Viennois","created_by":"Emilie Viennois","private_link":"BB85272BDE282C40AFCBEFC44F6AF0A0","original_img":"1","username":"emilie-viennois","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":269380,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Emilie Viennois","authors_list":[{"name":"Emilie Viennois","affiliation":"Gerorgia State University","username":"emilie-viennois","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","username":"emilie-viennois","full_name":"Emilie Viennois","created_by":"Emilie Viennois"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[]}
