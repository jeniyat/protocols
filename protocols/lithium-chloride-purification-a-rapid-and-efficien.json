However, the mechanisms of action of DSS remain poorly understood, and<br \/>observations by our laboratory and other groups indicate that DSS contamination of colonic tissues from DSStreated<br \/>mice potently inhibits the quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)<br \/>amplification of mRNA.\u00a0A prior study used poly-A-mediated mRNA purification to remove DSS from RNA extracts, but we herein report a second efficient and cost-effective approach to counteract this inhibition, using lithium chloride<br \/>precipitation to entirely remove DSS from RNAs. We also explored how DSS interferes with qRT-PCR process, and<br \/>we report for the first time that DSS can alter the binding of reverse transcriptase to previously primed RNA and<br \/>specifically inhibits the enzymatic activities of reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase in vitro. This likely explains<br \/>why DSS-treated colonic RNA is not suitable to qRT-PCR amplification without a previous purification step.<br \/>In summary, we provide a simple method to remove DSS from colonic RNAs, and we demonstrate for<br \/>the first time that DSS can inhibit the activities of both polymerase and reverse transcriptase. In order to reliably<br \/>analyze gene expression in the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated mice, the efficiency rate of qRT-PCR must be the<br \/>same between all the different experimental groups, including the water-treated control group, suggesting that<br \/>whatever the duration and the percentage of the DSS treatment, RNAs must be purified.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"50944","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"DSS","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":null,"version_class":"8326","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1509794341","protocol_affiliation":"Gerorgia State University","affiliation":"Georgia State University","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.kk3cuyn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Emilie-y2u2b4v2y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/pxdfw26.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"Emilie Viennois","created_by":"Emilie Viennois","private_link":"0B856FE850165F7AB3C6E67A3ADDC7A1","original_img":"1","username":"emilie-viennois","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Dextran sodium sulfate inhibits the activities of both polymerase and reverse transcriptase: lithium chloride purification, a rapid and efficient technique to purify RNA.\u00a0<em>Viennois et al.

Briefly, the principle of this technique is the following: A first molecule is coupled to the gold sensor surface. The solution containing the second molecule (the analyte) then is flowed over the surface. This creates a mass change on the sensor surface as the two molecules interact, which is detected in real time as a deflection of the resonance angle in mDeg. In that specific experiment, the gold chip was cleaned and treated as previously described [22-24]. After placing a chip into the BI-2000 SPR (Biosensing Instrument) machine each gold biosensor chip covered with carboxydextran was activated using a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide\/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC\/NHS) to form amide linkages between purified protein and the chipbound carboxydextran. Two successive injections of 2,400 units of M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (thermo Scientific) each were performed. The reverse transcriptase was previously purified using Slide-A-Lyser\u00ae Mini dialysis devices (ThermoScientific) and suspended in PBS. After coating the chip with reverse transcriptase, RNA, previously primed using random primers (Thermo Scientific) incubated at 42\u00b0C, or primed RNA incubated with DSS in different concentrations (0.05, 0.5, 5 g\/L) were passed over the chip twice. A two-step interaction curve was obtained. The first step involved adsorption of primed RNA to the maximal level. In the second step, when the flow of primed RNA concentration returned to zero, nonspecific adsorbed primed RNA were released with the running buffer. The deviation of the resonance angle thus decreased to a plateau located at a level above the initial baseline. We assessed the laser deflection as directly correlated to the binding level. We thus used the laser deviation angle as the optimal parameter for the binding affinity. All comparisons between the different solutions of primed RNA and primed RNA with different concentrations of DSS were performed as a measure of the laser deviation in mDegrees (mDeg).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Statistical analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Values were expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM).
