[8]. Starch (2 mg) was suspended in a tube containing 0.2 mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) buffer (pH 6.9) with 0.01 M calcium chloride as substrate. The tube was boiled for 5 min and then preincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min. Plant aqueous extract (1 mg) was dissolved with 1 mL of 0.1% of dimethyl sulfoxide in order to obtain a concentration of 1,000 \u00b5g\/mL; then 0.2 mL of aqueous extract was added to the tube containing the substrate solution, 0.1 mL of porcine pancreatic amylase in Tris-HCl buffer (2 U\/mL) was also added, and incubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. Finally, the reaction was stopped with 0.5 mL of acetic acid (50% v\/v) and centrifuged 5 min at 1,811 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0C. The assay was performed in triplicate. The a-amylase inhibitory activity was calculated using the formula (Ac<sup>+<\/sup>) \u2013 (Ac<sup>-<\/sup>) \u2013 (As - Ab)\/(Ac<sup>+<\/sup>) \u2013 (Ac<sup>-<\/sup>) \u00d7 100, where Ac<sup>+<\/sup>, Ac<sup>-<\/sup>, As, Ab are defined as the absorbance (595 nm) of 100% enzyme activity (only solvent with enzyme), 0% enzyme activity (only solvent without enzyme), test sample (with enzyme), and a blank (a test sample without enzyme), respectively.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"15373","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1536113101","protocol_affiliation":",Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.s9meh46","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t25433t2w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/003.png","full_name":"Maira Rubi Segura Campos","created_by":"Maira Rubi Segura Campos","private_link":"25E385BC14AD4BE207F395D2BA6B0FD9","original_img":"1","username":"maira-rubi-segura-campos","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Dineshkumar B, Mitra A, Manjunatha M.
