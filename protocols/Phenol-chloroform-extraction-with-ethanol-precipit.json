When phenol is saturated with alkaline buffer (e.g., Tris, pH 8), however, both RNA and DNA will partition to the aqueous phase, so the method can be used for total nucleic acid extraction. Either DNA or RNA can be specifically selected by digestion of the recovered total nucleic acids with RNase or DNase. If targeting RNA, an RNase inhibitor may be included to help ensure stability. If one wishes to isolate both RNA and DNA but in separate fractions by organic extraction, we recommend the use of the commercially available reagents TRI Reagent and TRIzol (see above). <br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although still in use, the popularity of organic extraction has waned somewhat as new extraction procedures have been developed that do not require the use of toxic organic compounds. In addition to the extra precautions that must be taken when handling phenol and chloroform during extraction, the disposal of the resulting organic waste is costly.","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"132413","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"F6076F6DD7024623AAF5CC88CC5301D1","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1502718636","components":[{"component_id":"975098","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"71FE553A380548E3AE3C5AFE83ADDE58","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":null,"order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":null},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"129404","previous_id":"975098","original_id":"0","guid":"EEC3807075CB4432BB5D4E6CC9E7B8D3","previous_guid":"71FE553A380548E3AE3C5AFE83ADDE58","component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"To
