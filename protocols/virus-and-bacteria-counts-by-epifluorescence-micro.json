The correct thickness is usually marked on the oil-immersion objective after a slash, or you can ask the lens manufacturer.<br \/><br \/><strong>Filtration apparatus<\/strong> Connect the filter flask or filter manifold to the secondary 1 l filter flask ('trap'\/waste reservoir) with appropriate diameter tubing. Connect the waste reservoir filter flask to the vacuum pump with tubing and hose clamps. At the vacuum pump end, we use a vacuum pump-protection filter to prevent liquids entering the vacuum pump, although this is optional. To set up the filter apparatus, first place the glass 25 mm filter holder in its silicone stopper (usually provided with the glass filter holder from Millipore) into the filter flask or a port in the multi-filter holder manifold. Once these are firmly in place, test whether you are getting good suction by turning on the vacuum pump and pipetting H<sub>2<\/sub>O onto the fritted glass filter base. Use a vacuum of &le; 25 cm Hg (~1\/3 atm).<br \/><br \/><strong>Glass 25 mm filter holder<\/strong> Note that the inside diameter of the filter funnel and the diameter of the porous fritted area of the glass base should be close to (or slightly larger than) the diameter of the porous part of the Anodisc filter (these filters have a non-permeable plastic outer ring); if the funnel or base is smaller, this might restrict the actual filtered area, which will need to be taken into account when calculating virus abundance (see Step 55).<strong><br \/><br \/>Reagent Preparation:<\/strong><br
