The majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that are generated from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. Breast cancer, as a kind of disease of which the cause can not be clearly identified, is regarded as a heterogeneous disorder. It has a wide variety of pathological entities and the heterogeneity is reflected by the following aspects: cell type composition and proportions\u2019 differences, the proliferation ability diversity between glandular and myoepithelial cells, the proliferation of progenitor cells, the therapeutic responses and outcome of patients.

Main Signaling Pathways in Breast Cancer Therapy<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Different sub types of BC are directed by different signaling pathways, for example, hormone receptor positive breast cancers are principally driven by the estrogen\/ER pathway; in HER2 positive breast tumors, HER2 activates the PI3K\/AKT and the RAS\/RAF\/MAPK pathways together with stimulating cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients who are suffering from triple-negative breast cancers, it has been confirmed that there involve deregulation of various signaling pathways (Notch and Wnt\/beta-catenin) and EGFR protein.

Even recognized as an intractable heterogeneous cancer, BC formation is featured with well-defined molecular subgroups which are based upon gene expression profiling relevant to the behavior of these molecular sub types tightly. Former researchers have put forward that the change in result of gene expression profiling have turned the view of BC, which also provides neo tool for the bio markers diagnosis. Actually speaking, the status of ER, PR, and HER2 has been adopted as predictive markers for the identification of a phenotype of high risk and for selecting most efficient therapies. Corresponding recombinant antibody products have gained the status of decisive role in BC diagnosis, like <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.antibody-creativebiolabs.com\/symbolsearch-her2%252Ferbb2.htm\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">HER2\/ErbB2 antibody<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">.

In the relevant area, attention has been paid to other actionable targets in cancer genomes for precision medicine utilizing the next-generation gene sequencing. To categorize BC into several prognostic groups, DNA micro-arrays and high-throughput reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays for various genes can be applied. Gene assays are used to make prediction of distant recurrence rate in early-stage breast cancer and to influence systemic therapy decisions. The tests rely predominately on the assessing ER and proliferation-related genes, such as Ki-67, and have largely replaced the use of others.
