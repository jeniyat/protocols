In order for our tools to 'find' your data, we expect it to be organized in a particular way. In all cases, we expect that you export the data to a subfolder in your export folder called 'raw'. Then, we expect each subject to get its own subdirectory in the 'raw' directory, with the subject name as folder-name (e.g., <em>sub-01CON<\/em>).
