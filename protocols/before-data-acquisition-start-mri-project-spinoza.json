If any irregularities are noticed they are solved by the Spinoza Centre REC-L, and if necessary by Philips Healthcare. If we find that it may have influenced previous scans sessions, the Spinoza Centre REC-L contacts the researcher about this. During the weekly check we perform the Philips system wide quick check, make a recording of the basic sequences with a phantom (and perform subsequent data-analysis to determine the behavior of the sequences) and run through a checklist to ensure that the stimulus material and the rest of the center are in working order. During the monthly check we recalibrate the system to ensure that the operation specs are always close to the optimal. We further perform more complete diagnostics, for instance on each of the 32 channels of the headcoil.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF"},{"id":699170,"guid":"0BB648F01A8C11E9829307BCDF4D15B5","previous_id":699023,"previous_guid":"0E60E3F1E20C4353BF2934546FC77A16","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"BB2341A420034EB4A87B9936DFF585FE","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Scan sequences"}},{"id":1054723,"guid":"1B66C35327A84487A0AAFC3937D732EB","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Below, you can download an overview of our standard set of scan sequences.
