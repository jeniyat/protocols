If any irregularities are noticed they are solved by the Spinoza Centre REC-L, and if necessary by Philips Healthcare. If we find that it may have influenced previous scans sessions, the Spinoza Centre REC-L contacts the researcher about this. During the weekly check we perform the Philips system wide quick check, make a recording of the basic sequences with a phantom (and perform subsequent data-analysis to determine the behavior of the sequences) and run through a checklist to ensure that the stimulus material and the rest of the center are in working order. During the monthly check we recalibrate the system to ensure that the operation specs are always close to the optimal. We further perform more complete diagnostics, for instance on each of the 32 channels of the headcoil.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF"},{"id":698416,"guid":"1BC9A2075C9A4E7FA973C4E9E7362E4F","previous_id":698407,"previous_guid":"13374B364A1D46FFA0246BD5DB7587D6","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"B5139144A931482E92CB8A847EAD8B75","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Ethical Approval"}},{"id":1054723,"guid":"BE5CCC102A904C45A3E2BD7FBC552FAC","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Make sure that all researchers and research assistants of the project, are familiair with the Rules and Procedures for Lab research.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Rules and Regulations Lab Research<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null}],"materials":[],"description":"<p>Dear researcher,<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This protocol\u00a0outlines the steps to start an MRI project at the Spinoza Centre Roeterseiland (REC).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you haven't had contact with Steven Scholte or Tinka Beemsterboer, make sure to contact them before completing this protocol.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You can reach us by email:<\/p>\n<p>Steven Scholte: h.s.scholte@uva.nl<\/p>\n<p>Tinka Beemsterboer: t.beemsterboer@uva.nl<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions for improving the workflow, don't hesitate to add comments to the steps in the protocol.<\/p>\n<p>Hope to see you soon!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Spinoza REC team,<\/p>\n<p>Steven Scholte, Tinka Beemsterboer, and Lukas Snoek\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","changed_on":1547630619}
