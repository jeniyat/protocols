There is a need for improved diagnostic methods to identify those with functional cognitive symptoms so that they might be offered appropriate treatment, protected from iatrogenic harms, and also in order to improve the specificity of prodromal neurodegenerative disease phenotypes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This study aims to identify elements of clinical, neurological, cognitive examination which can, in combination as part of a diagnostic scoring tool, accurately discriminate functional cognitive symptoms from those more likely to be due to neurodegenerative disease. The study will recruit 120 participants with mild or subjective memory symptoms (but not dementia) from memory, neurology, and neuropsychiatry clinics. Each subject will attend for a structured research assessment examining interactional, linguistic, metacognitive features, as well as psychiatric, physical, and sleep disorder comorbidity. Multiple outcomes will be compared with panel consensus diagnosis using discriminant factor analysis. The intention is to follow up medical record \/ general practice diagnosis at 1-2 years, and ultimately it is hoped that further studies beyond this will re-examine the cohort in the future. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1556098970}
