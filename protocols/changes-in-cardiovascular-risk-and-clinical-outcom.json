Changes using the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimator and changes in clinical outcomes were analyzed. The results were categorized as low or high CVR using a cut-off of 7.5%.<\/p>\n<p>The cardiovascular risk at baseline showed a mean of 4.45% \u00b1 6.1% (0.2% to 50.1%), which changed to 4.48% \u00b1 5.4% (0.2% to 33.2one year later . After cardiovascular risk stratification at baseline, we found that 84.3% of patients had a low CVR, and 18% of this group had metabolic syndrome. Moreover, 15.7% of this population was at high cardiovascular risk and 47% had metabolic syndrome. Approximately 4.3% of patients had a CVR increase and 2.6% had a cardiovascular risk decrease. Of the total patients, 22.3% had metabolic syndrome at
