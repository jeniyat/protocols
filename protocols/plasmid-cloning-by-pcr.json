Assuming you are amplifying from plasmid DNA (rather than from genomic DNA or a cDNA library), roughly 18-21bp is usually sufficient to give specificity and to also be compatible with a standard PCR reaction (see <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eEcy9k_KsDI\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">PCR Video<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">). Therefore, our Forward Primer will use the sequence <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5'-ATGTGGCATATCTCGAAGTAC-3' <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">for the region that binds the ORF and we will add the EcoRI restriction site (GAATTC) to the 5\u2019 end of this primer, making our Forward Primer <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5'-GAATTCATGTGGCATATCTCGAAGTAC-3'.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Many restriction enzymes do not cut DNA efficiently at the end of a linear piece (see <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.neb.com\/tools-and-resources\/usage-guidelines\/cleavage-close-to-the-end-of-dna-fragments#.UEecadBWrDY\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">NEB<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span> for more information). Thus, we recommend that you add 3-6 bases upstream of your restriction site to improve cutting efficiency. You can generally add any 6 bases, but you should ensure that the bases do not result in the formation of a hairpin structure within your primer. In our case, we will add TAAGCA, resulting in a <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">final Forward Primer sequence<\/span><span>: <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5'-TAAGCAGAATTCATGTGGCATATCTCGAAGTAC-3'.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">For the Reverse Primer, the design is similar, but we need to use the reverse complement to get PCR amplification. We can start similarly, taking the final 18bases of the ORF, including the stop codon (5'-TGGCATATCTCGAAGTACTGA-3'), then adding NotI (GCGGCCGC) and then TAAGCA to improve restriction enzyme digestion. This gives us a sequence of <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5'-TGGCATATCTCGAAGTACTGAGCGGCCGCTAAGCA-3' <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(30bp with 18bp of homology to the ORF).
