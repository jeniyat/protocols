Nutritional requirements or growth physiology for this insect has not been much known till date. We developed artificial membrane feeding method for leafhopper which can be further used for RNA interference studies. Main components of this diet were L-cysteine (5.0 mg), glycine (2.0 mg), nicotinic acid (1.0 mg), sucrose (500 mg), K<sub>2<\/sub>HPO<sub>4<\/sub>(50 mg), ZnCl<sub>2<\/sub> (0.04 mg), Thiamine HCl (0.25 mg), Vitamin B6 (0.25 mg), Becosules capsule powder (Pfizer Limited, USA) (2.0 mg), Green food dye (GanpatiSyn Food Colour, India) (2.0 mg) per 10ml of autoclaved double distilled water. To make diet accessible to the cotton leafhoppers the 1.5 ml of Microcentrifuge tube\u2019s (MCT) cap (Tarsons Products Pvt. Ltd. India) was removed and diet was filled in 2 layers of parafilm sachet (diet was poured on first layer of parafilm on cap and covered with another layer of stretched parafilm) into cap. The MCT\u2019s was cut 1\/4<sup>th<\/sup> from bottom end, which was covered with muslin cloth (40 count mesh size). This MCTs with leafhopper was kept in incubator at 65-70% RH, 14:10 h light and dark photoperiod and 27\u00b1 2\u00b0C.<img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qafh8k6.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/qaeh8k6.jpg\" data-ofn=\"Layout_Membrane_Feeding.jpg\" \/><\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<ol>\n<li>All apparatus (parafilm, knife, brush, forceps, scalpel, scissors, gloves) should be treated with DEPC solution prior autoclaving.<\/li>\n<li>All apparatus (parafilm, knife, brush, forceps, scalpel, scissors, gloves) should be autoclaved before use.<\/li>\n<li>Swab work bench with 75% ethanol<\/li>\n<\/ol>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"<ol>\n<li>Use sharp devices (Knife, scalpel, scissors, etc) carefully to avoid injury<\/li>\n<\/ol>","version_class":"8744","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1510559885","protocol_affiliation":"Punjab Agricultural University, Regional Research Station, Faridkot","affiliation":"Regional Research Station","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ksgcwbw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Satnam-y2v28403u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Satnam Singh","created_by":"Satnam Singh","private_link":"778ECAD842973B329F68CBCB04FFCB9C","original_img":"1","username":"satnam-singh","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<ul>\n<li>Satnam Singh, <strong><u>Mridula Gupta<\/u><\/strong>, Suneet Pandher, Gurmeet Kaur, Pankaj Rathore, Subba Reddy Palli.
