This is a good method to clean the water since ciliates will pass through the filter. Take care to not let the embryos\/larvae be exposed to air. Once\u00a0all the\u00a0water containing the embryos\/larvae has been poured through the filter, immediately immerse the filter in the new culture dish that is filled with FSW. Invert the filter to free the embryos\/larvae.<\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"640857","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"C2F0C7C6727349F4B6AD1FD545D5493F","previous_guid":"A1987A92F6F24B88ACDD20634E50266B","previous_id":"640856","last_modified":"1530899585","components":[{"component_id":"1139542","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"ACDBFF8FBC2A4C1D801B20509F24634B","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Embryo\/larvae handling","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Embryo\/larvae handling"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1139541","previous_id":"1139542","original_id":"0","guid":"C235162053E04669B61EFFF4E763E2B2","previous_guid":"ACDBFF8FBC2A4C1D801B20509F24634B","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>As noted in (Bucher et al. 2016), early cleavage stages take place a few hours post fertilization (hpf).
