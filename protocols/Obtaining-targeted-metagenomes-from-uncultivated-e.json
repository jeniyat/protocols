However, the ability to link viruses to their hosts in a high-throughput manner bottlenecks our ability to understand virus-host interactions in complex communities. Here, we present viral tagging (VT), a method that combines mixtures of isotope labeled host cells and fluorescent viruses with flow cytometry. In a single experiment, we can screen 10<sup>7<\/sup> uncultivated ocean viruses with a single strain of Synechococcus. These viruses can then be sequenced to quantitatively link objectively<br \/>defined environmental viral populations, and their genomes, to their hosts.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"2475","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen\u00ae dsDNA Assay Kit","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"P7589","reagent_url":"http:\/\/www.lifetechnologies.com\/order\/catalog\/product\/P7589?CID=bnk","reagent_vendor_id":"11","reagent_vendor_link":"http:\/\/www.lifetechnologies.com","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Life Technologies","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":"","version_class":"953","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1435168884","protocol_affiliation":"Matthew Sullivan Lab, University of Arizona, Ohio State University","affiliation":"University of Arizona","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.c6zzf5","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"VERVE-w2w29413x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bvfdk3e.jpg","full_name":"VERVE Team","created_by":"VERVE Team","private_link":"1F90095A6B3CD337FA442563D313EF91","original_img":"1","username":"verve-team","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"1","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":223986,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"45","group_uri":"verve-net","group_name":"VERVE Net","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/cdqcwwe.png","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"},{"group_id":"50","group_uri":"sullivan-lab","group_name":"Sullivan Lab","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/fxc3an.jpg","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"2","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Li Deng, Bonnie T.

While two decades of viral ecology research has focused on community level understanding through measuring viral abundance, production, decay, and frequency of infected cells (<em>reviewed by Ref<\/em><sup>1<\/sup>), little is known&nbsp;about the fundamental question of &ldquo;who infects whom?&rdquo;.<br \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;Cultivation-based methods can directly link a virus strain to its host; however, it is&nbsp;impossible to characterize millions of viruses per milliliter of seawater and thousands to&nbsp;100s of thousands of &ldquo;viral types&rdquo; per sampling site<sup>2<\/sup> using traditional low-throughput cultivation methods. For example, Fluorescently Labeled Viruses (FLVs) have been used&nbsp;as probes to &ldquo;tag&rdquo; their host cells for examination under the microscope<sup>3-5<\/sup>, a method that&nbsp;is limited only by being low-throughput. Here, as illustrated in Fig 1, we expand upon the use of FLVs to tag host cells by (i) incorporating flow cytometry to enable high- throughput detection and sequencing of infected host cells, and (ii) isotope labeling host cells to minimize the bacterial DNA in the viral tagging metagenome.<a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/src2xe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><br \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/stc2xe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/suc2xe.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/><strong>Figure 1.
