Young people in Ghana, though, face a number of challenges accessing the sexual and reproductive health information and services they need, as evidenced by high levels of unmet need for family planning, early pregnancy and childbirth, and unsafe abortion.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This project aims to explore the internal and external determinants of contraception use and use of services that address early\/teen pregnancy, unintended pregnancy, and unsafe abortion among youth in Accra. To do this, we plan to perform a cross-sectional survey with 250 sexually active females and 100 sexually active males aged 18-24 years living in Accra-Tema. If we are able to secure additional funding, we also plan to perform four focus group discussions (8-12 participants each) with sexually active females aged 18-24 years on determinants of reproductive health care utilization so as to get a more nuanced understanding of these issues and the survey findings. Participants of both study components will be recruited from 1-2 low- and middle-income communities in Accra-Tema. The findings of this study will help service providers to tailor programs to better meet the needs of young people in urban Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This project is being conducted by Ibis Reproductive Health, the University of Ghana School of Public Health, and Marie Stopes International\/Marie Stopes International Ghana (MSI\/MSIG).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"13688","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1531261683","protocol_affiliation":"Ibis Reproductive Health,School of Public Health, University of Ghana,Population Council,Marie Stopes International US,Marie Stopes Ghana","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.rkyd4xw","doi_status":"1","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"4323c4y2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","full_name":"Kate Grindlay","created_by":"Kate Grindlay","private_link":"5492454ABD6FE390D7C1861F9C99A86A","original_img":"1","username":"kate-grindlay","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0201663","manuscript_citation":"Grindlay K,  Dako-Gyeke P,  Ngo TD,  Eva G,  Gobah L,  Reiger ST,  Chandrasekaran S,  Blanchard K (2018) Contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy among young women and men in Accra, Ghana.
