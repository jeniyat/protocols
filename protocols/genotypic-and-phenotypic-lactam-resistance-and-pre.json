This study focussed on the phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance patterns of Staphylococci isolated from dairy cows during the early dry period.\u00a0 Among 96 isolates of Gram positive cocci from 157 cows, 76 were identified as Coagulase Negative Staphylococci and the remaining twenty were <em>Staphylococcus aureus.<\/em> Typical amplicons of coagulase gene were obtained for all twenty samples of <em>S. aureus<\/em> with three major coagulase types being identified as giving 627 bp (40 %), 910 bp (35 %) and 710 bp (25 %) long PCR products. The <em>groEL<\/em> gene was amplified in PCR of all 76 isolates of Coagulase Negative Staphylococci, and incubation of PCR products with restriction enzyme PvuII yielded three distinct PCR-RFLP fragment patterns bearing resemblance to <em>S. chromogenes <\/em>and<em> S. hyicus. <\/em>Highest sensitivity of Coagulase Negative Staphylococci was noted for Azithromycin (92.5%) and the least to Tetracyclines (76.3%), whereas for <em>S. aureus,<\/em> it was Cefoperazone (95%) and Azithromycin (72.2%) respectively. Phenotypic resistance to Oxacillin (25 isolates), and Cefoxitin (11 isolates) was detected by dilution method with a commercial strip (Ezy MIC<sup>TM<\/sup>). \u00a0Genotypic resistance to b-Lactam antibiotics was found in 65 (34 with <em>mecA<\/em> gene and 31 with <em>blaZ<\/em> gene) isolates. Eighteen isolates possessed both the genes, with the PVL gene for virulence being detected in five of them. Nine isolates which had <em>mecA<\/em> gene were phenotypically susceptible to oxacillin while phenotypic resistance to oxacillin was observed in seven isolates that did not have either <em>mec<\/em>A or <em>blaZ<\/em> gene. This is the first report of persistent Staphylococcal infections possessing PVL gene and high level of genotypic resistance to b-Lactam antibiotics in small- holder dairy cattle from India. \u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7428","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1503208391","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine,  College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Mannuthy, Thrissur, Kerala, India,","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jhccj2w","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2237423t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","full_name":"Vinodkumar Kulangara","created_by":"Vinodkumar Kulangara","private_link":"D4AB4791F9AE961CF595839AF1BB02B7","original_img":"1","username":"vinodkumar-kulangara","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":260388,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"179","group_uri":"biolegend","group_name":"BioLegend","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/jr3bjf6.jpg","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Staphylococci-MRS-PVL gene-bovine udder","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Vinodkumar Kulangara,Neetha Nair,Asok Sivasailam,Suchithra Sasidharan,Justin Davis and  Radhika Syam","authors_list":[{"name":"Vinodkumar Kulangara","affiliation":"Department of Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine,  College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Mannuthy, Thrissur, Kerala, India","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Neetha Nair","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Asok Sivasailam","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Suchithra Sasidharan","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Justin Davis and  Radhika Syam","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/002.png","username":"vinodkumar-kulangara","full_name":"Vinodkumar Kulangara","created_by":"Vinodkumar Kulangara"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"584064","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"65F8097F13B449BDAE5718F20EF1D50D","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1503208979","components":[{"component_id":"996351","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"18D9FE3D27454701A5C9BF6B9A5CADC9","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"Coagulase gene based typing for Staphylococcus aureusTwenty isolates of S. aureus were typed using the coagulase gene.Reagents","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"Coagulase gene based typing for Staphylococcus aureusTwenty isolates of S. aureus were typed using the coagulase gene.Reagents"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"996352","previous_id":"996351","original_id":"0","guid":"0A92CA87F88A44739103AAB4C6EA3080","previous_guid":"18D9FE3D27454701A5C9BF6B9A5CADC9","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"584065","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"1E0A88653A0445D195DE090B82C47008","previous_guid":"65F8097F13B449BDAE5718F20EF1D50D","previous_id":"584064","last_modified":"1503208979","components":[{"component_id":"996353","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"F3C31AE58ED044F080081F7D3C3DA80D","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"PCR reaction mix included Taq DNA polymerase, Taq buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2 (Sigma-   Aldrich, U.S.A)2.

The size of the fragments was determined by comparison with the 50 -bp DNA ladder (Fermentas) on a 2.5% agarose gel."},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"996368","previous_id":"996367","original_id":"0","guid":"891E24974EAB4A7E8C342741306EF967","previous_guid":"D1867124BC2D487D8CD2D8A5817A87CD","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"584073","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"B2C55D0788954A7E922660D54614BDDD","previous_guid":"6BB5637F8EEE4C97873920C00295A59D","previous_id":"584072","last_modified":"1503208979","components":[{"component_id":"996369","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"54D4F36E076F418D99A3BCDCB295609C","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"mec-A gene based PCR for identification of methicillin resistance in coagulase positive S. aureusMATERIALS AND METHODSAll the 20 isolates of coagulase positive S. aureus were analysed for presence of mecA gene.Reagents","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"mec-A gene based PCR for identification of methicillin resistance in coagulase positive S. aureusMATERIALS AND METHODSAll the 20 isolates of coagulase positive S. aureus were analysed for presence of mecA gene.Reagents"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"996370","previous_id":"996369","original_id":"0","guid":"EED5F152D3894ACC942451BC4D742075","previous_guid":"54D4F36E076F418D99A3BCDCB295609C","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"584074","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"63C3EA8ACA98425B88122EAFE2797A76","previous_guid":"B2C55D0788954A7E922660D54614BDDD","previous_id":"584073","last_modified":"1503208979","components":[{"component_id":"996371","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"EEB06C3335C84114A9676BB481A6E73F","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"PCR reaction mix included Taq DNA polymerase, Taq buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2 (Sigma-   Aldrich, U.S.A)2.
