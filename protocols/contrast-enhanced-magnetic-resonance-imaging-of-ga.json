The volumes were sampled approximately every 15\u00a0minutes for 4\u00a0hours. Specifically, the contrast\u2010enhanced lumenal volumes of the GI tract at different times were segmented, partitioned, and quantified separately from the volumetric scans by using an image processing pipeline. Note that some voxels in large veins with much shortened T1 and those in the renal medulla because of systemic Gd absorption might be mistakenly included in the above segmentation. Such spurious voxels were manually identified and excluded from the analysis. In addition, the heterogeneous image intensity (e.g. feces with unenhanced and\/or partly enhanced image intensity) in the colon raised difficulty in proper quantification of the colonic volume; hence, voxels in the colon were removed as well. The processing time for a 4\u2010hour volumetric dataset was about 1.5\u00a0hours. The volume of each compartment measured at intervals was further normalized as a percent of its initial volume at time 0. This normalization step allowed us to observe the relative volume change over time for each animal, while accounting for the varying amount of the meal intake and the preparation time for different animals. The time series of gastric volumes was resampled at 15\u2010min intervals for every animal and then averaged across animals to characterize gastric emptying at the group level.

The cross\u2010sectional areas (CSA) perpendicular to the proximal\u2010to\u2010distal antral axis were then calculated by summing the number of antral voxels within each cross\u2010sectional plane. By iteratively doing so for each volume, we obtained a time series that represented the CSA change of the antrum at different locations distant to the pylorus. In the CSA time series, the maxima of the time series indicated antral distension and the minima antral contraction (ie, the lumen was largely occluded by the depth of the constriction of the antral wall). The antral contraction frequency, occlusion amplitude, and velocity were computed from the time series. In this study, the antral motility indices were obtained from the middle antrum, which was 4.7\u00a0mm distant from the pylorus. This process was repeated for each volume. A time series that characterized the antral motility was obtained and resampled at 15\u2010min intervals for every animal and then averaged across animals. As VNS began at the start of the first volumetric scan (t\u00a0=\u00a00) and the volumetric scan and the fast scan took about 4 and 6\u00a0minutes, respectively, a 10\u2010minute delay was added to all time series.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA9F6C","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":695534,"guid":"7F53EBD200B241A0B199E6A9455E80B5","previous_id":695533,"previous_guid":"5AE0B06624F94214929F3CD053F5F918","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7E0439E356D84716B1DAD98300D92650","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Measurement of the size of the pyloric sphincter lumen"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"6CB92A9FB9A649B2A764823253301A3B","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">To measure the size of the pyloric sphincter, we manually determined a cross\u2010sectional plane that was perpendicular to the outflow direction of the terminal antrum on the segmented GI tract from the volumetric scans.
