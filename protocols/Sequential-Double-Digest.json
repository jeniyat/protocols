Add the first enzyme and incubate at the desired temperature. Then, heat inactivate the first enzyme, add the second enzyme and incubate at the recommended temperature.&nbsp;<br \/>Depending on an enzyme's activity rating in a non-optimal NEBuffer, the number of units or incubation time may be adjusted to compensate for the slower rate of cleavage.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><strong>Setting up a Double Digestion with a Unique Buffer (designated &ldquo;U&rdquo;)&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>NEB currently supplies three enzymes with unique buffers:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.neb.com\/products\/r0101-ecori\">EcoRI<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.neb.com\/products\/r0132-sspi\">SspI<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.neb.com\/products\/r0543-dpnii\">DpnII<\/a>.

of the reaction (using a small volume of a concentrated salt solution) to approximate the reaction conditions of the second restriction endonuclease.&nbsp;<br \/>Add the second enzyme and incubate to
