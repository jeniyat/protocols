Cortical excitability was assessed by motor evoked potential (MEP) and spinal cord excitability by the Hoffmann reflex (Hr), nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) and homosynaptic depression (HD). All measures were assessed before, immediately, 30 and 60 minutes after the experimental procedures.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"10602","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1519941319","protocol_affiliation":"Applied Neuroscience Laboratory, Department of Physical Therapy, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.nkidcue","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y20354z2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png","full_name":"Plinio Albuquerque","created_by":"Plinio Albuquerque","private_link":"45921D0539FC2AF90045ECE3671CA24E","original_img":"1","username":"plinio-albuquerque","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0195276","manuscript_citation":"Albuquerque PL,  Camp\u00ealo M,  Mendon\u00e7a T,  Fontes LAM,  Brito RdM,  Monte-Silva K (2018) Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and trans-spinal direct current stimulation associated with treadmill exercise in spinal cord and cortical excitability of healthy subjects: A triple-blind, randomized and sham-controlled study.
