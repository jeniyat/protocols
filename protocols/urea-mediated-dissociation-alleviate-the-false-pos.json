detection of antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Treponema pallidum<\/span><span> is essential to the diagnosis of syphilis. However, for the presence of cross-reaction, the specific antibody tests [e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] always have false-positive results. In this study, we derived and validated the dissociation of urea in an attempt to alleviate the situation of false-positive antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span> detected by ELISA. Six serum samples that were false-positive antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span>detected by ELISA, and 16 control serum samples (8 sera positive for both specific IgG and IgM, and 8 IgG-positive and IgM-negative sera) were collected to select the appropriate dissociated concentration and time of urea. Our goal was to establish improved an ELISA method based on the original detection system of ELISA. The sensitivity of the improved ELISA was evaluated by 275 serum samples with class IgM-positive antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span>. At 6 mol\/L with 10 minutes dissociation of urea, 6 samples with false-positive antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span> were converted to negative, and compared with true-positive antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span>. The sensitivity of the improved ELISA was 100% by detecting the class IgM-positive antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span> in sera of patients with syphilis. Considering the importance at the diagnosis of syphilis, antibodies to <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. pallidum<\/span><span>in serum samples should be retested by the improved ELISA method to avoid false-positive results. <\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1548250277}
