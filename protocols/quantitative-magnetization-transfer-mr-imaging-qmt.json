A Doty 38-mm inner diameter transceiver coil was used due to the large size of the diabetic mice. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with a 1.5%\/98.5% isoflurane\/oxygen mixture, and a constant body temperature of 37.5\u00baC was maintained using heated air flow. The structural imaging protocols used a field-of-view (FOV) of 34x34 mm2 . For kidney segmentation, water images (Fig. 1a-c) were obtained based on 3-point Dixon reconstruction (gradient echo sequence, TR =45 ms, flip angle = 35\u00ba, and multiple TEs were around 4, 4.5 and 5ms).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>To ensure that the same region was sampled for quantitative measures in non-invasive MRI and histological sections, quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) data were collected separately for left and right kidneys at the equatorial position for each kidney. This orientation of kidney is much easier to be defined than other orientations in histologic section. One example of the placement of a single oblique coronal slice at the equatorial position of the kidney was shown in Figure 1. We used both axial and sagittal anatomical images (Fig. 1a&b) to place the equatorial coronal slice (Fig. 1c). The qMT data set was collected using a 2D MT-weighted spoiled gradient recalled-echo sequence (TR 24 ms, flip angle =7\u00ba, matrix size 256x256, 24 acquisitions, resoltuion = ~0.133x0.133x1 mm3 ). Gaussian-shaped saturation pulses (\u03b8sat = 220\u00ba and 820\u00ba, pulse width = 10 ms) were used. The first data set was collected with 12 different RF offsets and a constant logrithmic interval ranged between 1 and 80 kHz for general quality of regional MT spectra in kidney (Fig. 1d). Previous qMT imaging of human brain has suggested the minimal number of RF sample points [2, 3]. However, due to the motion artifacts in kidney imaging, we acquired 7 RF offsets ranged between 1 and 80 kHz at two saturation powers to ensure an accurate modeling and derivation of qMT parameters in this study (which required ~34 min of imaging time).
