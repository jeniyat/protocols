Several pieces of equipment that we have can be \u201cdelicate\u201d and improper usage can cause thousands of dollars-worth of repairs to be made. You must also \u201clog in\u201d in the appropriate Log Book whenever you are using a piece of equipment. These notebooks are necessary for keeping the equipment properly maintained as well as information that can be very useful if something goes wrong (that way we can find out what was in a sample, etc\u2026 so the proper repairs can be made for minimal cost). Training is required for many laboratory items listed under the OJT (On the Job Training) section of this safety manual such as the following items: <\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    - Microscope<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  Balances<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  Sonicator<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  Image Analysis System<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  Spectrophotometers<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  PCR Machines<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  Glove Boxes<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">    -  Milli-Q Water System<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ordering \u2013 <\/span><span>Your PI will review ordering and procedures with you.
