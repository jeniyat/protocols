The ultrastructure morphology\u00a0of\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Schistosoma mansoni\u00a0<\/span><span>and\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. japonicum\u00a0<\/span><span>has revealed the existence of two secretory cell masses surrounding the oesophagus tube, referred to as anterior and posterior oesophageal glands (antESO and postESO, respectively). We recently established that the oesophageal glands have a pivotal role in the first steps of blood processing. For instance, erythrocyte and leucocyte are quickly neutralized along the oesophagus before they are propelled to the lower parts of the intestines for further digestion nutrient uptake. We knowledge that incorrect functioning of alimentary tract is associated with worms death by starvation. This was firstly observed in the self-cure response of Rhesus macaque (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Macaca mulatta<\/span><span>), the only known vertebrate\u00a0capable of combating the disease through worm elimination once the infection is stablished.\u00a0Classical immunoproteomics (2D-PAGE and Western blotting) has revealed potential targets in both exposed tegument and secreted gut proteins. Recently, a more detailed\u00a0investigation using the\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. japonicum<\/span><span>\u00a0in the Rhesus model shed light on the possible operating mechanisms that prevent parasite feeding on blood. Ultrastructural studies and immunocytochemistry on surviving worms indicated the esophageal lumen and the gland secretions as the primary targets of a potent and protective humoral immune response that ultimately disrupts the oesophageal functions. Therefore, the molecular characterisation of the oesophageal gland constituents is imperative\u00a0if one intends to emulate the Rhesus self-cure response for therapeutical purposes. However, this is not a trivial task and as\u00a0challenges are multiple. Perhaps, the most important caveat is that both anterior and posterior parts of the oesophageal gland represent a minor fraction of the whole parasite body (or even of its head), meaning that dominant constituents, such as those derived from muscle tissues, suppress the identification of the unique set of gland products. Indeed, our recent investigation on the soluble protein composition of a\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S. mansoni<\/span><span>\u00a0preparation failed to reveal their presence attesting for their low abundance. Although optimized protocols for chemical\/enzymatic dissection are\u00a0reported for\u00a0isolation of testes and ovary of adult worms, not a single method\u00a0has proved feasible for gastrodermal epithelium and the oesophageal gland cells. We tackled these challenges by developing a dissection technique of male and female worms preserved in RNAlater solution that entirely compatible with downstream\u00a0RNAseq and proteomics analyses.
