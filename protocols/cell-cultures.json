Briefly, PDLSCs were separated from periodontal ligament in the middle one-third of the root. Subsequently, MSCs were digested in a solution of 3 mg\/mL collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ, USA) and 4 mg\/mL dispase (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Single-cell suspensions were obtained by cell passage through a 70-\u03bcm strainer (Falcon, BD Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). MSCs were grown in a humidified, 5% CO<sub>2 <\/sub>incubator at 37\u00b0C in DMEM alpha modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 mmol\/L glutamine, 100 U\/mL penicillin and 100 \u00b5g\/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The culture medium was changed every 3 days. MSCs at passages 3-5 were used in subsequent experiments. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in complete DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U\/mL penicillin and 100 \u00b5g\/mL streptomycin. <\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"6312","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1497267428","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Prosthodontics, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.iegcbbw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2z2c413y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/011.png","full_name":"yuejun wang","created_by":"yuejun wang","private_link":"49A8BA478005FA3F741CB13037A6227F","original_img":"1","username":"yuejun-wang","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0184182","manuscript_citation":"Wang Y,  Liu Y,  Fan Z,  Liu D,  Wang F,  Zhou Y (2017) IGFBP2 enhances adipogenic differentiation potentials of mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord <i>via<\/i> JNK and Akt signaling pathways.
