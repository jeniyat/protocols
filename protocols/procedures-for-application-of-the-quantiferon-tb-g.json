After identification of the region of the pleural effusion in the patient, guided by chest ultrasound, asepsis and local anesthesia are performed. Then, under monitoring of vital signs, the physician aspirates the pleural fluid by using a surgical syringe;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Immediately after collection, the pleural fluid is stored in polypropylene tube without additives;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The samples are then transported in a thermal box to the laboratory for processing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Pleural fluid is homogenized in the polypropylene tube and then 1 mL of sample is pipetted into each of the three tubes of QFT-GIT.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>QFT-GIT Tubes are homogenized by inversion 10 times, carefully, for proper homogenization of the pleural fluid with the compounds in the respective tubes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>The tubes are then incubated at 37\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C as soon as possible for 16 - 24 hours in an incubator. The incubator does not require CO<sub>2<\/sub> or humidification.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>After incubation at 37\u00b0C, harvesting of pleural fluid supernatants is facilitated by centrifuging tubes for 15 minutes at 2000 to 3000 RCF (g) at 25\u00b0C. Samples are collected using a pipette in aliquots for each tube (Nil, Antigen, Mitogen) and stored at -20\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C until the immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) be performed. Samples can be loaded directly from centrifuged collection tube into the QFT ELISA plate.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><u>References:<\/u><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quantiferon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.quantiferon.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qiagen.com\/kr\/resources\/technologies\/qft_technology-spotlightpages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.qiagen.com\/kr\/resources\/technologies\/qft_technology-spotlightpages\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":null,"status_info":null,"steps":[]}
