Tissue is homogenized and put into a 2:1 chloroform and methanol mix. The mix is separated into two phases by adding a salt solution. The upper phase contains any non-lipid substances and the lower phase contains the chloroform with the lipids. The upper phase is removed and a sample is taken from the bottom phase and evaporated. The sample is reconstituted with 2-propanol with a volume to bring it to the desired concentration to assay.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\nTriglycerides are enzymatically hydrolyzed by lipase to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol is phosphorylated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with glycerol kinase (GK) to produce glycerol-3- phosphate and adenosine diphosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate is oxidized by dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP) by glycerolphosphate oxidase producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In a Trinder5 type color reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, the H2O2 reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) and 3,5-dichloro-2- hydroxybenzene sulfonate (DHBS) to produce a red colored dye. The absorbance of this dye is proportional to the concentration of triglycerides present in the sample.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Cholesterol esters are enzymatically hydrolysed by cholesterol esterase to cholesterol and free fatty acids. Free cholesterol, including that originally present, is then oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to cholest-4-en-3- one and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide combines with HBA and 4-aminoantipyrine to form\na chromophore (quinoneimine dye) which may be quantitated at 500-550nm.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557941597}
