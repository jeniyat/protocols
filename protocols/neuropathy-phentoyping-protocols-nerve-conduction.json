Diabetic neuropathy is a progressive disorder, with signs and symptoms that parallel the loss of nerve fibers over time. Consequently, assessments of neuropathy in mice are not performed at one time point, but are characterized at multiple time points during a 6 month period of diabetes. The degree of diabetes is evaluated in 2 ways: tail blood glucose measured following a 6 hour fast and glycated hemoglobin levels. The initial degree of neuropathy is screened using the methods discussed below. Detailed measures of neuropathy are employed when the initial screening instruments indicate a profound or unique phenotypic difference. This document contains protocols used by the DiaComp staff to examine and measure diabetic neuropathy at the whole animal, tissue and cellular levels.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Diabetic Complication:<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bit24kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1565970625}
