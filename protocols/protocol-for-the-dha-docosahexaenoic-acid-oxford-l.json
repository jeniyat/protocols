Our previous study (DOLAB) indicated that we should anticipate that 1300 children will need to be screened at the Local Authority stage. Of those approximately half are likely to consent to participate in these brief assessments at school. Those children whose parents consent, and whose reading assessment scores place them in the lowest quintile (on a standardized reading test), will be invited to join the study provided they meet the other inclusion\/exclusion criteria (n = 400). Baseline measures will be collected after which children will be randomly allocated to DHA Omega-3 or placebo conditions and followed up after 16 weeks. Recruitment will be carried out over two years.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Research Questions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em>Primary:<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p>- Can supplementation with DHA Omega-3 improve child behaviour and learning in underperforming children in year groups 3, 4 and 5 (who are generally aged 7-9 years)?<\/p>\n<p>Outcomes assessed will include reading performance, working memory and ADHD-type symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) as rated by parents.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><em>Secondary:<\/em><\/p>\n<p>- Can supplementation with DHA Omega-3 improve child ADHD-type symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) as rated by teachers?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div title=\"Page 5\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>- Do children\u2019s levels of DHA Omega-3 or related fatty acids (assessed objectively via a pinprick blood sample) predict their learning or behaviour?<\/p>\n<p>- Are any observed changes in behaviour or cognitive performance associated with changes in blood fatty acid status?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"1","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"119097","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"600mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 22:6, n-3","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":null,"version_class":"9196","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1513081003","protocol_affiliation":"University of Birmingham,,University of Oxford","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.k8kczuw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2x254z2w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png","full_name":"Thees F.
