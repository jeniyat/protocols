In this framework, the development of a capable and safe environment within which the patients could tackle their health problems was considered to be especially important; an environment enabling the patients to develop a deeper sense of connection and community, a safe place to let go of their emotional defenses, freeing them from the constraints and pressures of their home environments. Theory and evidence-based principles of learning and behavioral or lifestyle change as synthesized and reflected in the Precede\u2013Proceed (Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al 1999). Model of health promotion planning was applied (Kaati et al 2006). Lectures, demonstrations and group discussions, with or without a supervisor, took place daily. Most of the time, however, was filled with practical sessions, such as meal preparations and physical exercise.The diet was a diabetes diet that included salt restrictions and moderate calorie restrictions. In accordance with Nordic nutrition recommendations, breakfast provided 25% of a person\u2019s daily energy intake, 30% at lunch and dinner, and 15% between meals (Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 1980). The recommended portion sizes amounted to 1600-1800 kcal\/day for overweight individuals. Use of alcohol was not permitted and smokers were strongly encouraged to quit smoking.Physical training of moderate intensity was scheduled for 2 h\/day. Half an hour a day was devoted to autogenous relaxation. Towards the end of the residential period, patients prepared (with the support of the staff) a plan or contract for further improvement after they return home. The overall goal was to motivate and empower the patients to deal with their own health problems. The patients were taught in one large group about health-related issues (e.g. cooking, meal planning, tobacco, ways of coping with stress and body image) and encouraged to take part in health-promoting exercise (e.g. walking, swimming). This theoretical and physical training occupied 53 h during the 4-week period. Furthermore, varying time of individual guidance was given by a physiotherapist, a dietitian, a nurse and a physician during the period. The individual guidance was `problem- and individual-oriented' for each patient.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":773256,"guid":"96EB5B209B2611E9AC4E4F6ED4E0F336","previous_id":773255,"previous_guid":"96EB34109B2611E9AC4E4F6ED4E0F336","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"2C0ADD1016C648B798A06C6F93A22090","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"E54F281997D54296A24A8326A9BE7FE3","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Blood sampling and analysis.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Blood samples were drawn in the fasting state in the morning from all patients at the start of the program and at the final day of the four-week rehabilitation.
