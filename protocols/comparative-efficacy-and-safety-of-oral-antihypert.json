The present network meta-analysis aims to accumulate current evidence in the field in order to compare the efficacy and safety of all oral antihypertensive agents in pregnant women with pre-existing hypertension. To achieve this, Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar will be systematically searched. All randomized controlled trials and cohort studies will be included. Case-control, cross-sectional, as well as studies examining women with pregnancy-induced hypertension will be excluded. A frequentist random-effects network meta-analytic model will be implemented. Treatments will be ranked according to their estimated P-scores. Credibility of evidence will be evaluated under the GRADE framework with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CiNeMA) approach.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1578674434}
