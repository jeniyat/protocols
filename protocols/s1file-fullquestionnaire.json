However, its validity has never been tested, a shortcoming we address in this preregistered study. In the first task, self-control strength was temporarily depleted in the depletion condition (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">n<\/span><span> = 56) but remained intact in the control condition (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">n<\/span><span> = 56). The attention control video served as the secondary task, and we assumed that the depletion condition would perform significantly worse compared to the control condition. Attention regulation was measured with an eye-tracking device. The results revealed that the gaze behavior in the two conditions differed statistically significantly; however, the actual difference was small, indicating that the attention control video may not be an optimal measure of self-control.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1548259563}
