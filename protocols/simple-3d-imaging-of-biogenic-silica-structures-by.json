Hence, the poly-L-lysine (PLL) polymer is conjugated with fluorochromes molecules to allow its visualization by fluorescent microscopy. A wide variety of amine-reactive fluorescent dyes are commercially available for conjugation to proteins which allows a high flexibility regarding spectral properties of the fluorochrome moiety. The conjugation reaction on a poly-amine protein is then trivial and the different reagents are affordable.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The preparation of the conjugate is described by Colin et al. (2017), doi:10.7554\/eLife.26066. Briefly, in that case, the fluorescent dye moiety was an Alexa Fluor 546 NHS succinimidyl ester (AF546SE, Invitrogen A20002; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The PLL (Sigma-Aldrich P5899; Merck, Germany) display an average length of 2,340 lysine unit. The conjugation reaction was performed according to the AF546 provider\u2019s protocol for protein conjugation. The ratio [R-NH2]\/[AF546SE] was calculated to generate the statistical binding of one AF546 per 1500 lysine units. The stock solution of this conjugate was kept at \u221220\u00b0C.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null},{"id":685218,"guid":"92B70CDF03954CFEB6172898D57B8A62","previous_id":685217,"previous_guid":"3F3F4F410E304A7780EADE4076FD81A0","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"01529FEC683B43CFA1593403E58109E3","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":null}},{"id":1054723,"guid":"C066826722104A0589CD25AFF4C5F5C3","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Staining protocol.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span> Few milligrams of silica particles are resuspended in a 1ml of dd-H<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2<\/span><span>O in 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.

Since the thickness of the objects could be quite large, I would not advise a slide\/coverslip mounting. Instead, any petri dish or multi-well plate with a suitable optical bottom (I recommend a high quality glass bottom as close as possible to coverslip #1.5H) can be used with inverted microscope whereas upright microscope equipped with dipping objectives can image directly in the mounting media as far as your observation dish is large enough. For water immersion objectives, a simple mounting in water can be undertaken. It is a fast and straightforward mounting procedure as you can load the suitable amount of your suspension of particles in your observation container and start the imaging directly. However you may have a better 3D-imaging results if the mounting media match the glass refractive index. Indeed you would then be closed of an optimal optical homogeneity. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the refractive index of glass and biogenic silica (opaline) are not exactly similar. In that case, I suggest to load a suitable amount of particles in your observation container, to remove liquid and to oven dry the particles (~50\u00b0C, few hours or overnight). Then you can mount your labeled specimens directly in immersion oil or any other mounting media of your choice that matches glass refractive index as far as they are compatible with the stability of the staining (binding and fluorescence). Finally, glycerin immersion objective and glycerin mounting could be eventually a relevant choice as opaline refractive index range from 1.42 to 1.47. For light-sheet microscopy, the mounting can be adapted with hydrogel embedding (agarose, phytagel, polyacrylamide etc...).<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null},{"id":685220,"guid":"B301A69402634F34A7583BF3B36B019F","previous_id":685219,"previous_guid":"0FF47A23B56F4BD9AF07DC01F10794FB","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"F34A3465C693468D936B0A45E00868D8","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":null}},{"id":1054723,"guid":"82E53938A9D246FDA94EF3C180006F21","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Imaging.<\/span><span> Several fluorescence microscopy modalities can propose 3D tomography by optical sectioning.
