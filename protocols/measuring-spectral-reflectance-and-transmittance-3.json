This standard version of our\u00a0protocol describes\u00a0the common\u00a0case where an individual leaf is large enough to entirely cover the reflectance or transmission port of the integrating sphere. Briefly, six mature, healthy-looking and sunlit leaves from a canopy plant are selected for measurements of adaxial reflectance and transmittance. Leaf scans\u00a0are referenced to a calibrated Spectralon\u00ae disk\u00a0and corrected for stray light.\u00a0Our leaf spectroscopy protocol builds from <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B58dyv8L3FpMNnFTSUV4eENzS28\/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that<\/a> of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cao.carnegiescience.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carnegie Airborne Observatory<\/a>, as well as from integrating sphere user manuals from two companies (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.asdi.com\/products-and-services\/accessories\/integrating-sphere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASD Inc.<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spectravista.com\/spheres\/reflectance-sphere\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SVC<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<div>\n<ol>\n<li>Consult the user manual of the spectroradiometer and the integrating sphere to set up the instrument.<\/li>\n<li>The instrument should be set up in the shade, sheltered as much as possible from the elements.<\/li>\n<li>All canopy plants selected for measurements should have already been tagged, identified, and georeferenced before spectroscopy measurements start.<\/li>\n<li>The spectroscopist should be positionned as close as possible to the sampled plants to minimise time from collection to measurement.<\/li>\n<li>The spectroscopist should be in a confortable\u00a0position and have enough room around the instrument to spread leaf samples around without the risk of mixing up individual leaves during handling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Six mature, fully-developped, healthy-looking leaves from the sunlit (&gt;3 h per day of direct sunlight) portion of the canopy are selected<\/strong> for spectral measurements from the bulk leaf sample (often one of a few branches).
