These tasks<br \/>are typically divided into categories (e.g., egocentric or allocentric) that reflect different<br \/>two-systems theories. Unfortunately, this two-systems approach has been insufficient for<br \/>reliably predicting navigation performance in virtual reality (VR). In the present<br \/>experiment, participants were asked to learn and navigate towards goal locations in a<br \/>virtual city and then perform eight simple spatial tasks in a separate environment.<br \/>These eight tasks were organised along four orthogonal dimensions (static\/dynamic,<br \/>perceived\/remembered, egocentric\/allocentric, and distance\/direction). We employed<br \/>confirmatory and exploratory analyses in order to assess the relationship between<br \/>navigation performance and performances on these simple tasks. We provide evidence<br \/>that a dynamic task (i.e., intercepting a moving object) is capable of predicting<br \/>navigation performance in a familiar virtual environment better than several categories<br \/>of static tasks. These results have important implications for studies on navigation in<br \/>VR that tend to over-emphasise the role of spatial memory. Given that our dynamic<br \/>tasks required efficient interaction with the human interface device (HID), they were<br \/>more closely aligned with the perceptuomotor processes associated with locomotion<br \/>than wayfinding. In the future, researchers should consider training participants on<br \/>HIDs using a dynamic task prior to conducting a navigation experiment. Performances<br \/>on dynamic tasks should also be assessed in order to avoid confounding skill with an<br \/>HID and spatial knowledge acquisition.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7237","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1502239283","protocol_affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jbdcii6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x22344x2s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","full_name":"Jascha Gr\u00fcbel","created_by":"Jascha Gr\u00fcbel","private_link":"56737D04F44571BE34B6BAA55850ECDD","original_img":"1","username":"jascha-grbel","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0184682","manuscript_citation":"Gr\u00fcbel J,  Thrash T,  H\u00f6lscher C,  Schinazi VR (2017) Evaluation of a conceptual framework for predicting navigation performance in virtual reality.

Six Buildings in the city are named with a sign in front of them. The participant's navigation task is to visit all places in a given order. The participant is asked to use the shortest route possible. In case the participant does not know where to go, he may press the trigger to activate a 3D arrow\u00a0on the main screen that points to the direction to the destination destination. However, triggering the arrow decreases an energy bar which is displayed at the top of the main screen. Once the bar is empty, the arrow cannot be triggered for a couple of seconds. Aftter a few seconds, the bar slowly refills itself. The name of the current destination is shown at the top left corner. Whenever a destination is reached, the next destination will be announced with a pop-up text in the middle of the main screen.<\/li>\n<li>A short break between the stages. Give the participant the handout for stage 2 of the experiment. Open the window for this time. Ask the participant to read it carefully again and ask whether he has any questions.<\/li>\n<li>Stage 2 consists of 8 small tasks repeated 5 times. The first 8 repetitions are for training. The tasks are explained below. For all 8 tasks, the participant is situated on a green field surrounded by 20 spheres. In the base configuration, all spheres are white. To give the participant a hint of the\u00a0task he is currently performing, the key verb of his current activity is written on the top left corner.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The tasks for Stage 2 are described below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For task 1, the participant has to turn to the sphere that is currently highlighted blue. No translation movement is involved. When the participant looks at the sphere, he should press the trigger to indicate that he has finished the task. Note that the sphere must not be centered on the screen, it is enough to merely face the highlighted sphere directly. When the task starts, a short text description will be displayed in the center of the screen: <strong>'Look at the marked sphere'<\/strong>. The hint in the top-left corner reads 'Look At'.<\/li>\n<li>For task 2, the participant has to turn to the sphere that is currently highlighted blue on a map in the top-right corner. No translation movement is involved. Note that no sphere is highlighted in the 3D environment. The map only appears for the task and is not shown otherwise. When the participants thinks he has identified the sphere and is looking at it in the 3D environment, he should press the trigger to indicate that he has finished the task. Note that the sphere must not be centered on the screen. It is enough to merely face the sphere. When the task starts, a short text description will be displayed in the center of the screen: <strong>'Look at the sphere marked on the map'<\/strong>. The hint in the top-left corner reads 'Look At'.<\/li>\n<li>For task 3, the participant has to walk to the sphere that is currently highlighted blue. A small yellow circle appears on the screen in front of the participant. The sphere should be inside this marked area when the participant presses the trigger to indicate that he has finished the task. The position of the yellow circle is dependent on the participant's head orientation. It moves always such that it is right in front of the participant. When the task starts, a short text description will be displayed in the center of the screen: <strong>'Walk to the marked sphere'<\/strong>. The hint in the top-left corner reads 'Walk To'.<\/li>\n<li>For task 4, the participant has to walk to the sphere that is currently highlighted blue on a map in the top-right corner. Note that no sphere is highlighted in the 3D environment. The map only appears for the task and is not shown otherwise. A small yellow circle appears on the screen in front of the participant. The sphere should be inside this marked area when the participant presses the trigger to indicate that he has finished the task. The position of the yellow circle is dependent on the participant's head orientation. It moves always such that it is right in front of the participant. When the task starts a short text description will be displayed in the center of the screen: <strong>'Walk to the sphere marked on the map'<\/strong>. The hint in the top-left corner reads 'Walk To'.<\/li>\n<li>For task 5, the participant has to look at two highlighted spheres sequentially. Then, all spheres disappear, and the participant has to turn towards the direction where he thinks the first highlighted sphere was situated. The first two parts of the task work the same as task 1 but are accompanied with another text. Looking at the first sphere is accompanied by <strong>'Look at the first marked sphere'<\/strong>, whereas looking at the second sphere is accompanied with <strong>'look at the second marked sphere<\/strong>'. After looking at the second sphere and pressing the trigger, all spheres disappear and the participant stands on an empty square. The participant should turn around until he thinks he is facing the first sphere again. No movement is involved. When the participant thinks that he is facing the first sphere again, he presses the trigger to indicate that he has finished the task. The hint in the top-left corner reads 'Look At'. The last prompt is <strong>'Look at where you think the first sphere was'<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>For task 6, the participant has to walk to a sphere that is highlighted blue.\u00a0Unlike task 3, all of the spheres will disappear after the participant moves more than 1 meter. It is strongly recommended to first face the highlighted sphere and then move toward it as rotation alone does not trigger the disappearing of the spheres.

A small yellow circle appears on the screen in front of the participant. The moving sphere should be inside this marked area when the participant presses the trigger to indicate that he finished the task.

The map only appears for the task and is not shown otherwise. A small yellow circle appears on the screen in front of the participant.
