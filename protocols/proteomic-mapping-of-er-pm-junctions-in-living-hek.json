Store operated calcium entry mediated by dynamic STIM1-ORAI1 coupling constitutes one of the most well-established molecular events occurring at ER-PM junctions, but the protein composition at this particular subcellular compartment remain poorly defined. Using an in situ spatially-restricted biotin-labeling coupled with mass spectrometry, we mapped the proteome of intact ER-PM junctions in living cells without disrupting their architectural integrity. Our approaches lead to the discovery of >70 candidate proteins at ER-PM junctions, with the majority falling into the categories of ER\/PM-resident proteins, cytoskeletal components, and proteins functioning in intracellular membrane trafficking or post-translational modifications. Although the current protocol is limited to ER-PM junctions, the methods described herein can be readily extended to study other types of inter-membrane appositions in various types of cells.<\/div><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1559449923}
