We identified the trends and patterns of total antibiotic consumption in China\u2019s tertiary hospitals from 2011 to 2015. We retrospectively analyzed aggregated monthly surveillance data on antibiotic sales made to 468 hospitals from 28 provinces. Antibiotic consumption was expressed in DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID). We compared population weighted antibiotic consumption patterns in China with European countries using indicators from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC). Total antibiotic consumption in general, including all the specific antibiotic class except for aminoglycoside antibacterials, were significantly increased during the study period from an average of 7.97 DID in 2011 to 10.08 DID in 2015. In 2015, eastern regions consumed the most antibiotics if using population based calculation while west regions consumed the most using inpatient volume based calculation. Cephalosporins accounted for 28.6% of total DID, followed by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations with 20.0%, macrolides with 17.4%, and fluoroquinolones with 10.5%. Antibiotic in parenteral form were accounted for nearly half of all antibiotics. We used aggregated sales records data to monitor antibiotic consumption across China over a 6 year period. Although great efforts had been made through antibiotic stewardship in the past few years, total antibiotic consumption showed a significant upward trend during the study period. A consistent preferences for cephalosporins, macrolides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, as well as parenteral preparations was observed. More efforts are needed in the future to investigate the quality of antibiotic prescribing.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8775","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1510736643","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.,International Research Center of Medical Administration (IRCMA) of Peking University, Beijing, China","affiliation":"Peking University","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ktkcwkw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Haishaerjiang-y2v2c403u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/009.png","full_name":"Haishaerjiang Wushouer","created_by":"Haishaerjiang Wushouer","private_link":"994A8D7AF3E5C0718183AC827D0FBF03","original_img":"1","username":"haishaerjiang-wushouer","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0190314","manuscript_citation":"Wushouer H,  Tian Y,  Guan X,  Han S,  Shi L (2017) Trends and patterns of antibiotic consumption in China\u2019s tertiary hospitals: Based on a 5 year surveillance with sales records, 2011-2015.
