A single eggs collector consist of\u00a050 cm segments of polyethylene floating rope having a diameter of 0.8 cm. Each modulus has been installed on the seafloor at the beginning of the spawning period of the cuttlefish in a linear composition of 9 'seagrass' collectors. The modules have been\u00a0tested in two central Adriatic Sea areas (Senigallia and Portonovo, Italy) where trawling is forbidden (by low and by a presence of anti-trawling structures). The structures were fixed on the seabed close to the artificial reefs modules in order to protect them from heavy storms.<\/p>\n<p>This work was supported by the project \u201cProtection, improvement and integrated management of the sea environment and of cross-border natural resources \u2013 ECOSEA\u201d, funded by EU Adriatic IPA Cross-border Cooperation 2007-2013 (2\u00b0ord.\/0236\/0).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5bn2xfe.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5bn2xfe.jpg\" data-ofn=\"Seagrass nursery 3.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5di2xfe.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5dh2xfe.jpg\" data-ofn=\"Seagrass collector.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><video controls=\"controls\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5bp2xfe.mp4\" \/><\/video><\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"653514","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"AB5C6B64F047428AAEF7829F96E1E213","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1533821129","components":[{"component_id":"1172068","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"C112360B1F064419822CC11BF3964233","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1172069","previous_id":"1172068","original_id":"0","guid":"DE4A7B1E31FD45AABB4C7E85FF3F0EF4","previous_guid":"C112360B1F064419822CC11BF3964233","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]}]}
