Various radiotracers (see Radiotracer list below) are available for micro-PET (mPET) imaging in small animals. Trace amounts (<1 mCi, mice; <4 mCi, rats) of a short-lived radioisotope will be administered by iv, ip or sc injection prior to imaging.

In some cases, a small catheter (mouse or rat: 28 ga or 30 ga needle on PE10 or MicroRenathane tubing; rat: commercially available 22 or 24 ga iv catheter) will be temporarily inserted into the tail vein of the conscious or anesthetized animal for isotope injection.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     b.

A needle\/syringe or catheter plug is inserted into the end of the catheter until the radiotracer is ready to be injected. The isotope syringe is held in a syringe shield whenever possible to minimize radiation dose to personnel. The radiotracer uptake period prior to imaging is typically 0.5 hr, but may last from 0-2 hr depending on the protocol. During this time the animal may be continuously anesthetized or conscious. If the animal is anesthetized during this time, it is kept warm by a heat lamp or other heating device (e.g., Deltaphase pads).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3.

In some longitudinal studies, animals may be rescanned several times per week for several weeks. For some studies, two animals may be imaged simultaneously, each with its own nose cone for anesthetic delivery. For microCT imaging, x-ray contrast agents may be utilized to highlight certain soft tissue features, or to visualize the vascular system. The microCT contrast agent, Fenestra, is typical dosed at 0.2 ml\/20 g in the mouse, and 5-10 ml\/kg in the rat. Manufacturer recommendations will be followed for contrast agent injection within the allowable volume of injection.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5. In some cases, 2-3 small, low-radioactivity fiducial markers may be affixed to the fur or skin of the animal. These markers are visible on PET, MRIs and CT scans, and allow coregistration of the multimodal images, thereby providing the anatomical information afforded by CT or MRI imaging to better interpret the PET image.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     a. If attached to the skin, the animal will be shaved in the regions where the markers will be attached, and a commercial hair removal cream may be applied briefly to remove stubble if necessary.
