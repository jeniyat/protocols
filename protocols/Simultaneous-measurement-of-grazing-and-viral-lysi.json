Experimental design of viral lysis dilution assay (field assay). In Step 1, diluents were prepared ca. 2 h prior to Step 2, which entailed dilution with natural sample collected de novo at high tide. Samples were processed under dim light and at in situ temperature. Sample transfers were performed by siphoning or gentle pumping, avoiding damage to the organisms<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><strong>Notes:<\/strong><br \/><br \/>The viral lysis dilution assay has only been applied to <em>Micromonas pusilla<\/em> (Evans et al. 2003); therefore we checked the validity of this method for <em>Phaeocystis globosa<\/em>. The test experiment was conducted using an exponentially growing <em>P. globosa<\/em> Pg-G (1 \u00d7 10<sup>5<\/sup> cells ml<sup>\u20131<\/sup>) in combination with the lytic virus PgV-07T (Brussaard et al. 2004) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, as determined by the MPN assay (see preceding subsection). In order to simplify the interpretation of the test results no grazers were added; therefore, identical net growth rates were recorded for all dilutions with the 0.2 \u00b5m pore-size water, and thus the estimated grazing rate was not significantly different from zero (0.02 \u00b1 0.07 d<sup>\u20131<\/sup>, Fig. 2A). The dilution series with the &lt;30 kDa diluent yielded a regression slope of 1.3 \u00b1 0.07 d<sup>\u20131<\/sup>, which corresponds to the viral lysis rate\u00a0in this test since there was no grazing. Knowing that <em>P. globosa<\/em> undergoes lysis 14 to 16 h after infection (Baudoux &amp; Brussaard 2005), we conclude that the lysis rate obtained during the 24 h incubation originated from 1 lytic cycle. An independent 1-step lytic growth cycle experiment using the same strain of <em>P. globosa<\/em> and PgV validated the results of the dilution assay. The viral lysis rate (1.4 d<sup>\u20131<\/sup>) calculated from this growth experiment was comparable to that obtained with the laboratory viral lysis dilution assay (1.3 d<sup>\u20131<\/sup>). These tests demonstrated the utility and validity of the viral lysis dilution assay, allowing this method to be applied in the field to <em>P. globosa<\/em> (Fig. 2B).<br \/><br \/><strong>References:<\/strong>\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Brussaard CPD (2004a) Optimization of procedures for counting viruses by flow cytometry.
