Intermediates can be as expressed as their absolute concentrations or relative ratios by using known amounts of added reference standards to the sample. GC-MS can also distinguish between heavy labelled molecules (eg. <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>H- or <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">13<\/span><span>C-labelled) and the naturally occurring most abundant molecules. The use of metabolic tracers (eg. <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>H- or <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">13<\/span><span>C-labelled) can offer additional information that can lead to the understanding of interrelationships between the pools of intermediary metabolism, such as with the CAC, and specific metabolic pathways. Applications using tracers can also assess the turnover of specific metabolic pools under various physiological and pathological conditions.  <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The following SOP presents a relatively simple method that is sensitive for simultaneously measuring concentrations and heavy labelled molecules of CAC intermediates (relative and absolute) and other related intermediates of energy metabolism using GC-MS technology. Note: the following extraction procedure can also be used parallel analysis for acyl-CoA\u2019s and lipids (for details on isolating and mass spectrometry assay procedures see, refs 4-6).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References:  <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.
