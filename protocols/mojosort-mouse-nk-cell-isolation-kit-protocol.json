If working with fewer than 10<sup>7<\/sup> cells, keep volumes as indicated for 10<sup>7<\/sup> cells. For best results, optimize the conditions to your specific cell number and tissue. Prepare fresh MojoSort\u2122 Buffer solution by diluting the 5X concentrate with sterile distilled water. The purity of the CD3- CD49b+ NK Cell fraction typically ranges from 80 to 90%. Removal of dead cells is highly recommended prior to cell isolation. Dead cells can be removed using appropriate centrifugation media or other methods.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Product description and procedure summary: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The kit is designed for the isolation of mouse NK cells from lymphoid tissues. Target cells are depleted by incubating the sample with the biotin antibody cocktail followed by incubation with magnetic Streptavidin Nanobeads. The magnetically labeled fraction is retained by the use of a magnetic separator. The untouched cells are collected. These are the cells of interest; do not discard the liquid. Some of the downstream applications include functional assays, gene expression, phenotypic characterization, etc.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"3791","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1475098270","protocol_affiliation":"BioLegend","affiliation":"BioLegend","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.fxpbpmn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Kelsey-w2z29423v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/jr3bjf6.jpg","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/jikecje.jpg","full_name":"Kelsey Knight","created_by":"Kelsey Knight","private_link":"B16A10A3DF9E8EEBBBEF49E3F58946AA","original_img":"1","username":"kelsey-knight","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":229123,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"179","group_uri":"biolegend","group_name":"BioLegend","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/jr3bjf6.jpg","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"2","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"big_protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/jr2bjf6.jpg","big_protocol_img_ofn":"biolegend_square_logo_nocom.jpg","is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Kelsey Miller","authors_list":[{"name":"Kelsey Miller","affiliation":"BioLegend","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/jikecje.jpg","username":"kelsey-knight","full_name":"Kelsey Knight","created_by":"Kelsey Knight"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"<p><strong>Reagents and instruments required: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>MojoSort\u2122 Buffer (5X) (Cat.
