What alteration occurs due to their prolonged use in different organs of female reproductive tract? We aimed to observe the histopathological changes brought by the long term use of Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), which is the highly popular and promoted contraceptive in developing countries, in reproductive tract of female rat particularly in ovary and Uterine tube. There were significant changes in the histo-morphology of ovary and uterine tube of experimental group rat compared to the control group. Histological changes such as follicular atresia, medullary hemorrhage and atrophy of uterine tube\u00a0epithelium was seen in experimental group rat. In conclusion, long- term use of exogenous progesterone, such as DMPA for contraception has adverse impact in Female which outweigh the merits. Instead of promoting these hormonal product, which in long period attenuate the health of female, other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be publicized along with their efficacy.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>For this study, only healthy female rats of appropriate weight were taken.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Heath of the rat was assessed by observing thier appetite, movement and external appearance.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"<p>For drug dose conversion, Barnes and Paget rule must be followed.<\/p>\n<p>Safe site for the drug injection and route of administration must be specific.<\/p>\n<p>Always use a sterile gloves and syringe with small size needle.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Animal behaviour can be altered after treating with drug.
