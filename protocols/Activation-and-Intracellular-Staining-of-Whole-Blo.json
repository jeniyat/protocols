Notes <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1. Activated cell populations can be prepared from in vivo-stimulated tissues or from in vitro-stimulated cultures (e.g., antigen-specific activation or mitogen-induced). For cytokine and chemokine detection, it is critical to include a protein transport inhibitor such as brefeldin A (BioLegend Cat. No. 420601) or monensin (BioLegend Cat. No. 420701) in the last 4-6 hours of cell culture activation. The cells can be suspended and distributed to 12 x 75 mm plastic tubes or microwell plates for immunofluorescent staining.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>2. Different cytokines\/chemokines have different production peaks. In order to obtain optimal staining signals, the stimulation conditions for each stimulant need to be optimized.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>3. Some antibodies recognizing native cell surface markers may not bind to fixed\/denatured antigens. For this reason, it is recommended that staining of cell surface antigens be done with live, unfixed cells PRIOR to fixation\/permeabilization and staining of intracellular targets. Altering the procedure such that cells are fixed prior to staining of cell surface antigens requires that paraformaldehyde-denatured antigen reactive antibody clones be empirically identified.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To confirm specific anti-cytokine staining, a blocking experiment is recommended in which cells are fixed\/permeabilized then preincubated with an excess amount of unlabeled anti-cytokine antibody and\/or the recombinant cytokine of interest is preincubated with fluorophore-conjugated anti-cytokine antibody before its addition to the cells.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><br \/>1.
