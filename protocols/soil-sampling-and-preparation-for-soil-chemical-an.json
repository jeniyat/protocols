If the field is relatively even, i.e. with no obvious slopes, randomly select 10 to 20 points from which you will collect sub-samples of the fields\u2019 soil. Random sampling is good for small fields whether they are even or uneven. If the field is large with an obvious slope, then your sampling points can be along the slope in one straight line to get a better representation of the soils on the entire field and to help you sample the field quickly but thorughly. The grid sampling design, which is a more orderly version of random sampling is easier to use on large uneven fields. Zigzag sampling design could however also be used and it is more convenient. More sampling points may be needed on large fields. Avoid sampling depressions on a field or along the edges of a fields; these points must be treated differently as they could have different properties from the rest of the field.<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bc8ia.png\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bc8ja.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"2C7C279EFF0A4A38A3A32D3C461B1AD9","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bc8ia.png\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"654261FD365A49F4BACA26FC9B625BBC","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bc8ja.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":709180,"guid":"40616020321B11E9B898E3F55BFB90ED","previous_id":709179,"previous_guid":"5B724490321811E9B898E3F55BFB90ED","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"DA7DBD2FE22F44A889BC1A7EB65419E0","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Sub-sample collection"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"41366F26A6C7434481DB884FAD1500DE","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Take sub-samples of fields soil from each sampling point and place them all in a bucket. Before taking the soil from a sampling point, first remove surface litter from the surface of a sampling point. Remember that the soil is your main interest. Surface litter can be scrapped off using a hoe or spade. Using a hoe or spade cut out a thin slice of soil (about 5cm thick) from a depth of 0-20 cm i.e. from the soil surface to 20 cm below the soil surface. It is this slice of soil that you place in the bucket as a sub-sample. Ensure that the same quantity of soil is collected from the top to the bottom of the 0-20 cm depth.
