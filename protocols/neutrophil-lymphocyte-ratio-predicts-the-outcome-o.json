It is used as a predictor for clinical outcomes in cancers and cardiovascular disease. However, its relationship with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still disputed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aims: <\/strong>We sought to evaluate the association between NLR and ICH in this meta-analysis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods:<\/strong> Potentially relevant articles were searched in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE until April 8, 2018, with English restriction. Efficacy outcomes included major disability at 90 days, short-term mortality or in-hospital mortality. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled to estimate the prognostic role of NLR in ICH.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results<\/strong>:A total of 7 trials with 2176 patients were included. The results of our meta-analysis revealed that high NLR had a higher risk of major disability at 90 days (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.27-3.81) and higher mortality at short-term (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.68); without statistically significant association with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.91\u20131.15).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions: <\/strong>Our meta-analysis proves that higher NLR was a predictor of major disability at 90 days and higher mortality at short term in patients with ICH, but not a predictor of in-hospital mortality.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"13077","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1529049710","protocol_affiliation":"first affiliated hospital of Shantou university medical college","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.qzvdx66","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2u25403y2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png","full_name":"weiduan zhuang","created_by":"weiduan zhuang","private_link":"1EB00D58BDCB5A1E656284EBB24BE1EC","original_img":"1","username":"weiduan-zhuang","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":323386,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"weiduan zhuang","authors_list":[{"name":"weiduan zhuang","affiliation":"first affiliated hospital of Shantou university medical college","username":"weiduan-zhuang","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png","username":"weiduan-zhuang","full_name":"weiduan zhuang","created_by":"weiduan zhuang"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"637262","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"15E9C34BF21B44B5A068A361D1D9D008","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1529049719","components":[{"component_id":"1130412","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"FA2B5B46BDC04AC8A62FFC9E7311613D","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1130413","previous_id":"1130412","original_id":"0","guid":"6FD5ABFBAD28402993F2C30407D7CEF0","previous_guid":"FA2B5B46BDC04AC8A62FFC9E7311613D","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]}]}
