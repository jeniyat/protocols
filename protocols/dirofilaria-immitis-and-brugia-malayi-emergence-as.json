These are referred to as emerging L3 or eL3. This assay can be used to quantitatively measure how mosquito manipulations or filaria manipulations affect eL3. This assay can be performed on groups of individual mosquitoes in a 96-well plate, or en masse in a large petri dish. The latter format is useful for producing large numbers of eL3 for assays, such as motility, molting, transformation, or for infection of a naive host animal. In addition, since the assay can be performed on large number of input mosquitoes with little increase in effort or cost, it offers a favorable low-tech alternative to other mosquito infection diagnostic methods, such as PCR or dissection when live-caught mosquitoes are available.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol assumes that you are starting with a population of infected mosquitoes by a filarial nematode.

Emerging L3 are produced as early as day 12. The last day that we have checked is 21 days post infection, but it is very likely eL3 can be produced for the lifespan of the infected mosquitoes.
