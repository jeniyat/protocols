To explore whether human cells have this ability to adapt, the Herrera team uses islets from diabetic donors and non-diabetic donors. They first classified different cell types, focusing on two of them: alpha cells (cells that produce glucagon) and sputum cells (cells that produce pancreatic polypeptide). Herrera explains, \u201cWe divided the cells we obtained into two groups: in one group of cells, we introduced only one fluorescent cell tracer, and in another group, we added a gene of \u03b2-cell-specific insulin transcription factor.\" <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Nowadays, Peptide-based treatment is becoming increasingly important for diabetes treatment, including <\/span><a style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Ghrelin Peptides<\/span><\/a><span>and Glucagon Like Peptides.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1554275816}
