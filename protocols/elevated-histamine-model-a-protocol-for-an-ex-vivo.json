In some complications of pregnancy such as <em>hyperemesis gravidarum<\/em> (HG), spontaneous abortion (SA), pre-term labour (PL) and Pre-eclampsia (PE) histamine levels increase as pregnancy proceeds (Southren<em> et al.,<\/em> 1966; Achari, Achari and Rao, 1971; Beaven<em> et al.,<\/em> 1975), and the elevated levels of histamine may directly cause some of the features of these disorders (Brew and Sullivan, 2006).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Placenta is a major source of histamine, but it also releases active diamine amine oxidase (DAO; EC 1.4.3.22) into the maternal circulation, which metabolises histamine (Kapeller-Adler, 1944; Gunther and Glick, 1967; Semeniuchenko, 1975; Granerus, Gillbrand and Wetterqvist, 1977; Purcell and Hanahoe, 1991; Brew, Lakasing and Sullivan, 2007).\u00a0 This breaks down the histamine released from the placenta in normal pregnancy, leading to the limited changes in maternal blood histamine. Clinically, the deported placental DAO activity in maternal blood increases a 1000 fold during normal pregnancy (Southren<em> et al.,<\/em> 1966).<\/p>\n<p>The DAO activity rises exponentially in the first 24 weeks of normal gestation and plateaus thereafter to form a normal histamine-DAO-axis (nHDA) (Southren<em> et al.,<\/em> 1966; Beaven<em> et al.,<\/em> 1975; Dubois<em> et al.,<\/em> 1977) (Ahlmark, 1944; Southren<em> et al.,<\/em> 1966; Gunther and Glick, 1967; Weingold and Southren, 1968; Tufvesson, 1978; Beaven<em> et al.,<\/em> 1975; Dubois<em> et al.,<\/em> 1977). In contrast, the spontaneous exponential rise of DAO activity is abrogated from gestational week 8 onwards thus, leading to a defective Histamine-DAO-Axis (dHDA) in pregnancies that present with elevated maternal blood histamine (Southren<em> et al.,<\/em> 1966; Achari, Achari and Rao, 1971; Beaven<em> et al.,<\/em> 1975; Legge and Duff, 1981). <em>Ex-vivo<\/em> defective Histamine-DAO-Axis also referred to Elevated Histamine Model (EHM) was developed to mimic <em>in vivo<\/em> dHDA to study effects of histamine in human placenta. The EHM was developed by creating <em>in vitro<\/em> culture model to represent normal placentae with nHDA and complicated placentae with dHDA. In the nHDA samples, the endogenous DAO activity is maintained to eliminate endogenous production of histamine, while DAO activity is blocked with aminoguanidine in the dHDA samples to allow histamine levels to elevate during the treatment period. Aminoguanidine is a specific inhibitor of DAO enzyme activity (Tamura<em> et al.,<\/em> 1989).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7092","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1503482945","protocol_affiliation":"University of West London, Paragon House, Boston Manor Road, Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom,Institute of Reproductive & Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Du Cane Road, London, United Kingdom","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jigckbw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x213a4z2t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/007.png","full_name":"Obed Brew","created_by":"Obed Brew","private_link":"3AD83C1395605595D6C2CE8792C6C6B8","original_img":"1","username":"obed-brew","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":257150,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Obed Brew,Mark HF Sullivan","authors_list":[{"name":"Obed Brew","affiliation":"University of West London, Paragon House, Boston Manor Road, Brentford, Middlesex, United Kingdom","username":"obed-brew","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/007.png"},{"name":"Mark HF Sullivan","affiliation":"Institute of Reproductive & Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Du Cane Road, London, United Kingdom","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/007.png","username":"obed-brew","full_name":"Obed Brew","created_by":"Obed Brew"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"<p>Note:<\/p>\n<p>Syncytiotrophoblast degeneration starts within 24 hours of explant culture and peaks by 48 hours.
