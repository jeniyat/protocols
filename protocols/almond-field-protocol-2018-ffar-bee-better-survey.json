Carry the nest in an upright gentle fashion and place inside of the car. You will need to collect larvae, pollen, and mud from each nesting hole later. At this stage, the larvae are very sensitive and the pollen can squish them, so do not tip nests over, keep faces slightly tipped upwards as you carry nests. Nests can sit on their backs (with the tubes facing upward) if necessary while transporting them to the lab<\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"646576","is_changed":"0","original_id":"605336","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"CD2C08DDFF2C4AE6A9E30B30596EC38E","previous_guid":"E06FBBBB5018406584F25F4230A86ED8","previous_id":"646575","last_modified":"1532373579","components":[{"component_id":"1154124","previous_id":0,"original_id":"1048844","guid":"CBA3C66E66AD4529BCCB70C36782E6DE","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"Osmia\/Nest Collection","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Osmia\/Nest Collection"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1154125","previous_id":"1154124","original_id":"1048843","guid":"709DBF0264ED49F48D2E923F446752A5","previous_guid":"CBA3C66E66AD4529BCCB70C36782E6DE","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Between field sites, throw away your gloves and use a new pair.
