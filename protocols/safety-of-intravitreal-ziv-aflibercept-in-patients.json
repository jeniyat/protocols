Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) such as aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab have become the standard of care for diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema (ME) following retinal vein occlusions (RVO), and neovascular age related macular degeneration(nvAMD). Aflibercept has been approved by the United States of America (USA) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of DME, nvAMD, and ME following RVO. The recommended dose of intravitreal aflibercept is 2mg in 0.05ml administered monthly or initial monthly injections for the first 3 months followed by 2 monthly injections. Aflibercept is highly expensive (USD1850 per dose) and not available in many developing countries including Ghana. Ziv-aflibercept, a molecule structurally identical to aflibercept but differs due to its formulation with hyper-osmolality has been approved by the USA FDA for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers. Ziv-aflibercept, used off-label, has been found to be safe in patients with DME and nvAMD in phase 1 trials at a dose of 1.25mg in 0.05ml. The cost of compounded ziv-aflibercept is much reduced to USD 67 per dose. The 1.25mg dose of ziv-aflibercept is below that recommended for intravitreal injections of aflibercept. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no data available on the safety of 2mg of ziv-aflibercept, although <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">in vitro<\/span><span> studies indicate that it is safe.
