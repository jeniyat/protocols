Following isolation of T cells from fresh human blood samples, it is possible to culture, expand, and manipulate these cells, which allows extensive investigation for research purposes. Techniques for isolation and handling of T cells are well-established but parts of the protocols can highly vary across different labs. These differences in the protocols are, often, there due to historical reasons and are only supported by anecdotal evidence. We systematically modified basic components of the T cell culturing protocols and collected data on how they altered the final yield. Here, based on these data, we provide practical hints and tips on basic cellular and molecular techniques for handling primary human T cells. We hope that this guide will serve as a reference point to allow evaluate, discuss, and improve current practices in T cell culturing and manipulation.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"materials_text":null,"warning":null,"version_class":"12917","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1541538562","protocol_affiliation":"Medical University of South Carolina","affiliation":"Medical University of South Carolina","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.vdee23e","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"BulentArmanAksoy-x2x2a443","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/zejvm5.png","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/yg9vm5.png","full_name":"Bulent Arman Aksoy","created_by":"Bulent Arman Aksoy","private_link":"2B87B07EF0C1B85D66B51530BAC11D9F","original_img":"1","username":"bulent-arman-aksoy","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"journal_link":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":370115,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[{"protocol_name":"CRISPR\/Cas9-based knock-out in human primary T cells (24-well setup)","protocol_name_html":"CRISPR\/Cas9-based knock-out in human primary T cells (24-well setup)","protocol_id":"12919","version_id":"0","last_modified":"1528600252","link":null,"fork_id":null,"number_of_steps":"22","vendor_id":"1","downloads":"0","views":"34","uri":"crispr-cas9-based-knock-out-in-human-primary-t-cel-quxdwxn","description":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This protocol has been optimized for <\/span><a href=\"&quot;https:\/\/www.thermofisher.com\/us\/en\/home\/life-science\/cell-culture\/transfection\/transfection---selection-misc\/neon-transfection-system.html?c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thermo Fisher\u2019s Neon Electroporation System<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is based on the report <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2017\/12\/07\/183418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reprogramming human T cell function and specificity with non-viral genome targeting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
