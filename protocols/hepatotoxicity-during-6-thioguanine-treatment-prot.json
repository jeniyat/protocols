Since then, 6-TG associated hepatotoxicity in the form of acute sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), also known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD), has notably been reported in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), whereas chronic nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) has been reported in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as in childhood ALL. However, SOS and NRH should be considered part of a spectrum of microvascular disorders caused by endothelial injury. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the sinusoidal damage, being pivotal to their development, remain to be established. 6TG-related SOS and NRH have been hypothesised to be dose-related, since they do not seem to occur with low cumulative doses.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">The recent finding that higher levels of thioguanine nucleotides incorporated into leucocyte DNA (DNA-TGN) correlate to a lower relapse risk, calls for reappraisal of the feasibility of prolonged 6TG treatment for childhood ALL, while avoiding the risk of SOS and NRH.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objectives<\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">- Primary objective: To assess the incidence of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with 6TG compared to 6MP or standard care.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">- Secondary objective: To explore if a safe dose of 6TG can be established.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1553676053}
