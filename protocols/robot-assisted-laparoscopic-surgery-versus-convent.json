Among a total of 1,517 articles, 27 clinical reports with a mean sample size of 65 patients per report (32.7 patients who underwent RLS and 32.5 who underwent CLS), met the inclusion criteria.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FINDINGS: <\/strong>CLS shows significant advantages in total operative time, net operative time, total complication rate, and operative cost (<em>p<\/em> &lt; 0.05 in all cases), whereas the estimated blood loss was less in RLS (<em>p<\/em> &lt; 0.05). As subgroup analyses, conversion rate on colectomy and length of hospital stay on hysterectomy statistically favors RLS (<em>p<\/em> &lt; 0.05).<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: <\/strong>Despite higher operative cost, RLS does not result in statistically better treatment outcomes, with the exception of lower estimated blood loss. Operative time and total complication rate are significantly more favorable with CLS. More RCT evidence is needed to be accumulated in order to enable full subgroup analyses on each surgical procedure.<\/p>\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">\u00a0<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"1","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9172","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1512942269","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Biomedical Science, Hanyang University College of Medicine and Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Seoul, Korea.,Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Hanyang University Guri Hospital, Guri, Gyunggi, Korea.,Department of Microbiology and Biomedical Science, Hanyang University College of Medicine and Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Seoul, Korea.","affiliation":"Project nGene.org","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.k7ucznw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Hyunsuk-y2x244x2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/005.png","full_name":"Hyunsuk Roh","created_by":"Hyunsuk Roh","private_link":"899545EA7EEC8CE875058A6ED2DF00F2","original_img":"1","username":"hyunsuk-roh","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0191628","manuscript_citation":"Roh HF,  Nam SH,  Kim JM (2018) Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery versus conventional laparoscopic surgery in randomized controlled trials: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
