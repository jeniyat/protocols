The quality degradation and excessive fat accumulation in cultured <em>C. idellus<\/em>\u00a0have long been attributed to possible alterations in the lipid metabolism of fish muscle tissues as a result of over-nutrition from artificial diets. To investigate the effects of different diets on fish muscle quality, a large-scale metabolomics study was performed on 250 tails of <em>C. idellus. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>The experimental fish were divided into four groups based on sex and diets - female artificial feed (FAF), female grass feed (FGF), male artificial feed (MAF) and male grass feed (MGF). After 113 days rearing period, the AF group showed significantly higher total mass of muscle fat (P &lt; 0.01), with the FAF group being the highest. Metabolomics profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed distinctive patterns of clustering according to the four groups. Overall, artificial feeding was associated with higher concentrations of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (ARA); whereas grass-feeding was associated with elevated n-3 unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 UFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Artificial feeding also resulted in significant increased docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in MAF muscle than MGF fish, whereas no significance in the comparison of female samples. Metabolic pathway analyses using both targeted and untargeted approaches consistently revealed that the arachidonic acid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways were significantly different between AF and GF groups.<\/p>\n<p>Our results suggested that grass is a better source of diet fatty acid and protein when compared to artificial feed. Grass feeding could effectively lower triglycerides in serum, reduce fat accumulation and alter lipid compositions in fish muscle by increasing the concentrations of n-3 UFAs, leading to better nutrition and health.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"14729","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1534262572","protocol_affiliation":"College of Fisheries, Hubei Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Pond Aquaculture, National Demonstration Center for Experimental Aquaculture Education, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China,Institute of Parasitology, and Department of Animal Science, McGill University, Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC H9X 3V9, Canada","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.smhec36","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t244x2w2u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","full_name":"Dapeng Li","created_by":"Dapeng Li","private_link":"ADC83F736C5D83BF9EABC2C0E48FFA72","original_img":"1","username":"dapeng-li","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":340178,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[{"protocol_name":"DNA Methylation Signatures Predict HIV Prognosis and Mortality","protocol_name_html":"DNA Methylation Signatures Predict HIV Prognosis and Mortality","protocol_id":"14725","version_id":"0","last_modified":"1534341310","link":null,"fork_id":null,"number_of_steps":"6","vendor_id":"1","downloads":"0","views":"30","uri":"dna-methylation-signatures-predict-hiv-prognosis-a-smdec26","description":"<p><strong>Background<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effects of tobacco smoking upon epigenome-wide methylation signatures in white blood cells (WBCs) collected from persons living with HIV may have important implications for their immune-related outcomes, including frailty and mortality. The application of a machine learning approach to the analysis of CpG methylation in the epigenome enables the selection of phenotypically relevant features from high-dimensional data. Using this approach, we now report that a set of smoking-associated DNA-methylated CpGs predicts HIV prognosis and mortality in an HIV-positive veteran population.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods and Findings <\/strong>A total of 1,137 DNA samples were extracted from WBCs in HIV-positive male veterans. Here, HIV prognosis was measured by Veteran Aging Cohort Study Index that was highly correlated with HIV disease frailty. We first conducted two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for tobacco smoking in two HIV-positive sample sets. We then selected smoking-associated DNA methylation features using a machine learning approach to differentiate good and poor HIV prognosis and to predict mortality. The performance of the prediction was validated in an independent sample set. We identified137epigenome-widesignificant CpGs in meta-EWAS analysis for smoking in HIV-positive samples (p &lt; 1.70E-07). Using an in-house developed bioinformatic pipeline, we selected 698 CpG sites that predicted high HIV frailty [(Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.73, (95%CI: 0.63 ~ 0.83)] and was replicated in an independent sample [(AUC = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.73 ~ 0.83)]. We further found an association of a DNA methylation index constructed from the 698-CpGs that were associated with a 5-year survival rate [HR =1.46; 95%CI: 1.06 ~ 2.02, p = 0.02]. Interestingly, the 698-CpGs located on 445 genes were enriched on the integrin signaling pathway (p=9.55E-05, False discovery rate=0.036), which is responsible for regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, and adhesion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong>We demonstrated that smoking-associated DNA methylation features in white blood cells predict HIV infection prognosis and mortality in a population living with HIV. Feature selection is a powerful approach to identify DNA methylation biomarkers for the prediction of medical outcomes.<\/p>","public":"1","created_on":"1534259793","first_published_date":"2018-08-15
