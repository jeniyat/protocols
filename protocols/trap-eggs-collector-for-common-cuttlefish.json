This structure\u00a0was similar to the traps commonly used by fishers, with the exception that this one was not hanged with a net so allowing the escapement of cuttlefish. A total of 111 collectors were deployed\u00a0along the Marche region (Italy) in March, at the beginning of the spawning season, and kept at sea until July. During this period the collectors are regularly checked in order to evaluate the common cuttlefish eggs coverage.<\/p>\n<p>This work was supported by the project \u201cProtection, improvement and integrated management of the sea environment and of cross-border natural resources \u2013 ECOSEA\u201d, funded by EU Adriatic IPA Cross-border Cooperation 2007-2013 (2\u00b0ord.\/0236\/0).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5d82xfe.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5d72xfe.png\" data-ofn=\"Trap collector.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5ea2xfe.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/5d92xfe.jpg\" data-ofn=\"Trap collector.jpg\" \/><\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"653770","is_changed":"0","original_id":"653514","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"328342936E614062BB42893D2C26A3E0","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":null,"last_modified":"1533895287","components":[{"component_id":"1172723","previous_id":0,"original_id":"1172068","guid":"BEB652449B79491BB3B299125D80049B","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1172724","previous_id":"1172723","original_id":"1172069","guid":"9A09EC5E66EC41EFAD41E66007BBFCDA","previous_guid":"BEB652449B79491BB3B299125D80049B","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]}]}
