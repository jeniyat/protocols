That is why the need to search for new compounds with antimicrobial potential arises. One of the most widely used techniques for evaluating the antimicrobial potential of different compounds is the Disk diffusion method, which evaluates the qualitative and semi-quantitative antimicrobial potential of compounds from different natures, having as principle the diffusion of the compounds on agar matrix with elements (culture medium) that allow the growth of microorganism. On the other hand, a method that complements the antimicrobial analysis is broth microdilution, which is a quantitative method. This method allows us to determine the minimum concentration required to inhibit the growth of any microorganism, which in turn helps to determine appropriate doses to evaluate in further methodologies.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1553789164}
