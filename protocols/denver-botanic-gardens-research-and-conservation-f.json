Elevations on the plains rarely exceed 6,000 feet (1829 m). Foothills, which occur at the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, form a transition zone between the plains and the mountains, extending from 6,000 (1829 m) to about 8,000 feet (2438 m) in elevation.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Grasslands (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n Graminoids (grasses, rushes, sedges) are the most common and obvious vegetation. Forbs and a few shrubs or trees may be present. The plains of Colorado are in the shortgrass zone, but fingers of mid-grass prairie extend into the short-grass prairie, and patches of tall grasses occur in riparian areas where conditions are sufficiently moist year-round.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Short-grass prairie<\/span><span>\n Short-grass prairie covers much of the eastern plains, occurring on drought-prone, mildly alkaline, medium and fine-textured soils. The character of the short-grass prairie is shaped by aridity; average annual precipitation is between 10 and 16 inches (25-40 cm). Mid grasses are able to survive during periods of moderate conditions, but are replaced by blue grama and buffalograss during and following events of stress such as drought or overgrazing. In the absence of such stress, mid-grasses such as needleandthread, sideoats grama, junegrass, and Sandberg bluegrass are common and even dominant, and the many associated forbs can turn the prairie into a colorful wildflower garden in wet summers. Western wheatgrass may form monotypic stands in swales and depressions on clay-rich soils. Few shrubs grow consistently in short-grass prairie because the soils are too dry and compacted to support them; yucca, cacti, fourwing saltbush and rabbitbrush are the most common woody plants on the prairie.\n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Mid-grass prairie<\/span><span>\n Mid-grass prairie is found on the western edge of the plains near the foothills and also in pockets in southeastern Colorado on sandy or loamy soils. Here, with generally greater annual precipitation and less stress from drought or overgrazing, grasses of medium height are able to survive.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Tall-grass prairie<\/span><span>\n Tall-grass prairie is extremely uncommon in Colorado, occurring only in very small pockets along the Front Range where natural and artificial subirrigation supplements soil moisture. It requires well-drained soils that stay moist; this is a difficult combination in the arid climate of eastern Colorado. Individual tall grass species can be found where localized environmental factors support their growth. \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Foothills grassland<\/span><span>\n Localized environmental conditions at the base of the foothills support grasslands at higher elevations than is typical of the eastern plains. Pockets of mid and tall-grass prairie species occur with foothills species on sites in the foothills where soils have a very high content of coarse rock fragments. Most commonly, foothills grasslands are composed of mid-grass species, and include occasional shrubs.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Shrublands (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n Shrubs are the most common and obvious vegetation. Graminoids, forbs, or bare ground may cover the understory. There may be a few trees present.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Saline bottomland shrublands (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n These communities occur on alkaline flats and slight depressions where periodic saturation has caused salts to accumulate as a white crust on the soil surface. Only a few specially adapted species of plants can tolerate these extremely alkaline soils.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Sand sagebrush prairie<\/span><span>\n Sand sagebrush prairie occupies sandy soils of the plains, primarily in the northeastern and southeastern corners of the state but also in other isolated areas where sandy soils occur. The porous nature of sand allows deeper water infiltration, giving deep rooted shrubs the opportunity to grow more abundantly here. Taller bunch grasses are common in this community, although they tend to drop out in heavily grazed areas.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Mixed foothills shrubland<\/span><span>\n These mixed shrublands occur on canyon slopes and on hillsides in the foothills zone. In the northern counties, shrublands consist primarily of skunkbush sumac (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Rhus trilobata<\/span><span>), mountain mahogany (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Cercocarpus montanus<\/span><span>), currant (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ribes cereum<\/span><span>), and in some places bitterbrush (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Purshia tridentata<\/span><span>). In the southern counties, the composition of the shrublands changes, and Gambel's oak (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Quercus gambelii<\/span><span>) becomes the dominant component.\n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Woodlands (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n Woodlands (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)\n Trees are the most obvious vegetation but they are widely spaced. Canopy cover is usually less than 40%. Graminoids, forbs, or shrubs may be present in the understory. Woodlands occur in the foothills zone and where canyons on the plains create foothills-like conditions.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Pinon pine-juniper woodlands (Eastern Plains and Foothills)<\/span><span>\n Pi\u00f1on pine-juniper woodlands occur in draws, on escarpments and mesas, and on rocky hillsides. Annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches (30-46 cm). Trees tend to be short and widely spaced. Either pi\u00f1on or juniper may dominate; generally, juniper is more abundant at the lower end of the elevational range.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ponderosa pine woodland and savanna<\/span><span>\n Ponderosa pine woodlands and savannas occur primarily on dry, fire-prone south-facing slopes and have grassy understories with few shrubs.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Wetlands (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Marshes (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n Marshes are dynamic wetlands that typically receive flows of water in the spring, sometimes resulting in flooding and relatively deep water, followed by dropping water levels later in the season\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Playas (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n Ephemeral ponds, or playas, occur in wide, shallow depressions throughout the plains. During spring, water collects in these depressions forming small, shallow ponds. Later in the summer, the ponds usually dry, leaving a grassy swale of sedges, rushes and grasses.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Meadows (Eastern Plains and Foothills Region)<\/span><span>\n Wet meadows occur on the eastern plains where the water table is high enough to saturate the soil for some portion of the growing season. This can occur along reservoirs and playas where springs emerge, or in irrigated pastures.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Riparian communities (Eastern Plains and Foothills)<\/span><span>\n Typically, riparian forests and shrubland communities of the plains occur along streams that meander and braid through wide, flat main channels. Patches of cottonwoods typically form the canopy layer, with sandbar willow along the stream edge and grasses, such as switchgrass and prairie cordgrass, between cottonwood clumps. In the foothills or in canyons on the plains, streams tend to be narrower with swifter flowing water. Foothills riparian areas often have dense shrub layers composed of willows, currants, plums, chokecherries and hawthorn.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Cottonwood\/willow shrublands and forests<\/span><span>\n On the plains, woody vegetation, mostly plains cottonwood and sandbar willow, germinates on the bare sandbars formed by meandering streams. A variety of grasses and forbs grow underneath and in open areas around these trees and shrubs.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-weight:bold;\">Rocky mountain region<\/span><span>\n This region lies between the plains and foothills to the east and the plateaus, canyons and lowlands to the west. The southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado are a complex group of well-defined ranges which have been carved by glaciers and eroded by streams to form steep, rugged canyons and ridges. This section also describes the vegetation of the great intermountain basins or \u201cparks\u201d (North Park, Middle Park, South Park) and the San Luis Valley, which are geographically part of the mountain region, but which may also share climatic and floristic characteristics with the eastern and western regions of Colorado.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Grasslands (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Grasslands are a minor but important part of the Rocky Mountain region's vegetation. They occupy specialized habitats where the climate is too cold or dry and\/or the soils are too shallow to support the growth of trees and shrubs. In general, grasslands are small, providing openings within the forested zone, but the entire floor of South Park is a montane grassland. Two major types of grasslands have been distinguished on the basis of elevation. Montane grasslands occur between approximately 8,000 and 10,000 feet (2438 3048 m) and subalpine grasslands occupy favorable habitats between approximately 10,000 feet and treeline.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Montane and subalpine grasslands<\/span><span>\n Small mountain grasslands and meadows are interspersed between the various forest communities and occur primarily on flat or gently sloping terrain with shallow to deep fine-grained soils. Large expanses of grassland or meadow communities are concentrated in parts of North, Middle, and South parks, the Wet Mountain Valley, the perimeter of the San Luis Valley and parts of the upper Rio Grande Basin (Benedict 1991). These grasslands range from moist to dry depending on exposure, their proximity to the water table and soil characteristics.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Shrublands<\/span><span>\n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Sagebrush shrublands<\/span><span>\n Sagebrush shrublands are most extensive in western Colorado, but also cover certain areas of the Rocky Mountain region. Two major types may be distinguished on the basis of elevation and soils. Basin big sagebrush shrublands occur at lower elevations on deep soils of floodplains and arroyos; they occur throughout western and southern Colorado. This type is dominated by basin big sagebrush (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Artemisia tridentata<\/span><span> ssp. tridentata), a tall shrub up to seven feet (2 m) in height. Understory vegetation tends to be sparse but other shrub species are common associates. Mountain big sagebrush communities occur at higher elevations on convex sites and on shallower soils than basin big sagebrush communities. Mountain big sagebrush is the dominant plant species of this type, but it may be replaced by black sagebrush at lower elevations on rocky soils and it intermixes with basin big sagebrush growing in similar size on many sites. Mountain big sagebrush communities may include a variety of shrubs and an abundance of wild flowers. It occurs at upper elevations adjacent to aspen, oak-serviceberry, and coniferous forest.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Woodland (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Open woodlands of limber and bristlecone pines occupy dry, rocky, wind-swept sites in the Rocky Mountain region.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Limber and bristlecone pine woodlands<\/span><span>\n Limber pine can be found on a variety of windy, exposed sites as low as Pawnee Buttes in northeastern Colorado, but they are generally found above 9,000 feet (2743 m). Limber pine is most common in northern Colorado; bristlecone pine is limited to southern and central Colorado.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Poderosa Pine woodlands<\/span><span>\n These woodlands occur at the lower treeline\/ecotone between grassland or shrubland and more mesic coniferous forests typically in warm, dry, exposed sites.

They are closely spaced, and canopy cover is greater than 40% percent. Graminoids, forbs or shrubs make up the understory.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Douglas-fir forests<\/span><span>\n Forests dominated by Douglas-fir are found from 6,000 to 9,500 feet (1829-2896 m) throughout Colorado. In the foothills, Douglas-fir forests are confined to rocky soils on cool north-facing slopes and in shaded canyons, but in the montane zone, they may be found on slopes of all aspects. In northern Colorado, Douglas-fir may occur in pure stands or share the canopy with a few ponderosa pines, Rocky Mountain juniper, or Engelmann spruce. In southern Colorado the forest is much more mixed; Douglas-fir, white fir, southwestern white pine, ponderosa pine, and Engelmann spruce may vie for dominance in these middle-elevation forests.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Lodgepole pine forests<\/span><span>\n In Colorado, lodgepole pine is an upper montane and subalpine species whose range overlaps that of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, except that lodgepole pine does not occur naturally west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and south of the Gunnison River (Crane 1982). In general, lodgepole pine replaces Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir after catastrophic fires on dry sites, where it forms dense stands. Few herbaceous plants and shrubs are able to tolerate the deep shade of these \u201cdoghair thickets\u201d.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Aspen forests<\/span><span>\n Aspen forests are distributed on moist deep soils and scattered shallow soils in all mountain zones except the alpine. At lower elevations, aspen forests reach into the upper foothills zone along ravines where conditions are cool and moist; in the montane and subalpine, aspen may form large groves on slopes and narrow borders on valley bottoms.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests<\/span><span>\n Forests of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir form extensive stands in the subalpine zone (9300-11,400 feet\/2835-3475 m) of the Rocky Mountain region and extend down into the montane zone in cool ravines. These fairly homogeneous expanses of forest are occasionally interrupted by stands of lodgepole pine (in northern Colorado) or aspen, grasslands, meadows or wetlands.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Alpine tundra<\/span><span>\n Alpine tundra extends from treeline (approximately 11,400 feet\/3475 m) to the mountain tops. The cold, extremely windy climate produces harsh growing conditions. As a result, plants are mostly small, low, perennial and adapted to a short growing season.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Alpine meadows<\/span><span>\n Alpine meadows are common on level to gently rolling sites with fairly deep, well-drained, finetextured soils. Dry meadows (turfs) occur in areas where snow does not accumulate in the winter or melts early, typically on windward slopes and ridges. Meadows in more mesic areas are found on gentle slopes or in shallow basins.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Wetlands (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Most of the naturally-occurring wetlands in Colorado are found in the montane and subalpine zones. There are a number of reasons for this. First, it rains and snows more at higher elevations. Second, air temperatures are cooler at higher elevations, so there is less evaporation than on the plains. Third, most of the montane and subalpine zone was glaciated during the last ice age, and glaciers tend to turn narrow, V-shaped mountain valleys into broad, flat, U-shaped valleys more suitable for wetland development.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Marshes (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Marshes occur in a variety of situations in the Rocky Mountain region of the state. Natural lakes dot the higher portions of the mountains where snowmelt from the high peaks collects in basins. In the San Luis Valley, the perennially high water table creates numerous shallow ponds with ideal conditions for marsh development. In lower elevation areas, dams by humans and beavers create small and large bodies of water.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Playas (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Shallow playas, also called internal drainage basins or ephemeral ponds, are most extensive in the San Luis Valley. During spring, water collects in these depressions forming small, shallow ponds. Later in the summer, the ponds usually dry, leaving a grassy swale of sedges, rushes, and grasses.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Meadows (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Wet meadows of sedge, arctic rush, tufted hairgrass and other grasses occur along streams and around ponds in the broad mountain valleys. Wild iris may dot the meadows especially in heavily grazed areas. These meadows form where the soils are saturated in the spring and early summer, but usually dry out later in the summer. Salt meadows occur in areas of high surface salinity where the water table is close to the surface and where evaporation exceeds precipitation. Salt meadows are common in lower and middle elevations in Colorado and are most extensive in South Park and in the playas of the San Luis Valley. Greasewood shrubs are present within the playas where they grow on low sand dunes on the playa bottom or in a band along the upper playa margins.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Fens (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Fens occur on organic soils nourished by both surface runoff and groundwater sources. They can be found in relatively flat, constantly wet mountain valleys. Peat accumulation in fens occurs slowly, at a rate of about eight inches every 1,000 years (Cooper and Jones 1993). Rich fens, fens on soils rich in calcium carbonate and other salts, are extremely rare in Colorado, but are most common in South Park.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Riparian communities (Rocky Mountain Region)<\/span><span>\n Along mountain streams, discontinuous patches of forest intermix with shrub communities and herbaceous wetlands. Forests of narrowleaf cottonwood, river birch, mountain alder, and clumps of aspen occur along the banks of the Colorado streams. Along permanent streams in cooler canyons, blue spruce, Douglas-fir, and white fir (southern Colorado) anchor the banks. At higher elevations, Englemann spruce becomes the dominant tree.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Willow cars<\/span><span>\n A waterlogged, woody terrain. Willow carrs occur on organic soils along montane and subalpine streams, on broad floodplains inundated by beaver dams, around the edges of sedge-dominated fens, and around glacial lakes and on solifluction terraces in the alpine zone.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Riparian forests<\/span><span>\n Riparian plant communities consist largely of deciduous forests on lower montane streams and rivers and evergreen forests of higher elevations.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Alpine riparian communities<\/span><span>\n Herbaceous riparian communities occur in the tundra along the headwaters of streams.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Western Plateau and Canyon Region<\/span><span>\n This region lies west of the Continental Divide and below 8,000 feet (2438 m). Like the Rocky Mountain region, it is geographically and vegetationally complex. The unifying theme in this region is the relatively flat-lying layers of sedimentary rocks forming extensive highlands. The Colorado River and its major tributaries (the San Juan, Dolores, White, Yampa and Gunnison rivers) have cut deep canyons into the layers of rock. The region shares floristic affinities with the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Basin and the Uintah Basin regions of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Grasslands<\/span><span>\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Grasslands (Western Plateau and Canyon Region)<\/span><span>\n Grasslands and meadows occur primarily on fine-grained or deep soils on moderate to low slopes or on steeply sloping sites, and may be small patches interspersed among shrubland, woodland or forest communities. These areas range from mesic to dry depending on soil characteristics and the availability of ground water.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Shrublands (Western Plateau and Canyon Region)<\/span><span>\n In western Colorado, shrubland communities separate out by elevation and soil type. The \u201cadobe badlands\u201d so common at the lowest elevations near Grand Junction and in the northwestern and southwestern corners of the state support mat saltbush shrublands. Greasewood and fourwing saltbush shrublands occur in alkaline depressions with clayey soils and a high water table (\u201cflats\u201d) in the same areas. Deeper, coarser soils at middle elevations support sagebrush shrublands, and hillsides near lower treeline support mixed mountain shrubland communities\n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Mat saltbrush shrublands<\/span><span>\n Mat saltbush shrubland usually occurs on the driest sites below 6,000 feet (1829 m), usually on soils derived from shales of the Mancos and Green River formations. The total vegetation cover often does not exceed 10 percent. Gardner\u2019s and mat saltbush seem best adapted to these harsh growing conditions and therefore are the dominant species.\n  \n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Saline bottomland shrublands (Western Plateau and Canyon Region)<\/span><span>\n Saline bottomland shrubland usually occurs below 7,500 feet (2286 m); it is common on broad valley floors from Wyoming to the New Mexico border and west into Utah. On moist alkaline soils developed from stream deposits, greasewood forms pure stands. As alkalinity and depth of alluvium decrease, greasewood is found with shadscale and other saltbush species\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Sagebrush shrublands (Western Plateau and Canyon Regions)<\/span><span>\n Basin big sagebrush shrublands occur at lower elevations on deep soils of floodplains and arroyos; they are especially well developed in the Piceance Basin. This type is dominated by big sagebrush (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Artemisia tridentata<\/span><span>). Mountain sagebrush communities occur at higher elevations and on shallower soils than Basin big sagebrush communities. Mountain big sagebrush is the dominant plant species of this type, but it may be replaced by black sagebrush at lower elevations on rocky soils or by alkali sagebrush on heavy clay soils.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Mixed mountain shrubland<\/span><span>\n Mixed mountain shrublands occur at elevations between the pi\u00f1on pine-juniper woodland and upper montane coniferous forest communities. The shrubland consists of Gambel\u2019s oak growing either in pure stands or with mountain mahogany, serviceberry and\/or snowberry. The shrubs form a dense canopy restricting the understory to relatively few shade tolerant graminoids and forbs.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Woodlands (Western Plateau and Canyon Regions)<\/span><span>\n Woodlands occur on rocky hillsides at middle elevations and often define lower treeline. They are characterized by having one or more species of small trees \u2013 Utah juniper, Rocky Mountain juniper or pi\u00f1on pine \u2013 dominant in the topmost layer of vegetation. Because these trees require more moisture and deeper soils than shrubs or grasses do, woodland communities are restricted to rocky, mesic sites in draws and north-facing escarpments below 6,000 feet (1829 m), and dry slopes among ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir communities above 6,000 feet.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Pinon pine-juniper woodlands (Western Plateau and Canyon Region)<\/span><span>\n Pi\u00f1on pine-juniper woodland communities occur on shallow, rocky soils in warm, dry sites. They often occur on hillsides and mesa tops, and this community will invade sagebrush shrublands and Great Basin grasslands in the absence of fire. Gravelly substrates with high levels of calcium and alkaline salts provide the optimum growth medium\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Ponderosa pine woodlands<\/span><span>\n Pine woodlands are composed predominately of ponderosa pine. They typically consist of open stands on dry south-facing slopes with a shrub and herbaceous understory. These woodlands form the ecotone between the Rocky Mountain region and the Western Plateau and Canyon region, except in northwestern Colorado, where they are absent and replaced by pure stands of Douglas-fir and aspen. These communities are similar to the pine woodlands in the foothills east of the Rocky Mountain region.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Wetlands (Western Plateau and Canyon Region)<\/span><span>\n The landforms of western Colorado are an interesting mosaic of mountains (Uinta, Park, Gore, Elk, Sawatch and San Juan Ranges), mesas (Battlement and Grand), plateaus (White River, Roan and Uncompahgre), and basins (Wyoming, Piceance and San Juan). Major river systems draining the region and sometimes forming large canyons and valleys, include the Yampa, White, Colorado, Gunnison, Dolores and Animas. Wetland and riparian communities are as varied as the terrain; many are extremely saline or alkaline\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Marshes (Western Plateau and Canyon Regions)<\/span><span>\n Freshwater marshes occur in water less than 1.5 feet (0.5 m) deep and on adjacent saturated soils. Typical associated plant species include softstem bulrush, broad-leaved cattail, spike-rush, Arctic rush and arrowhead. Alkaline and saline marshes are characterized by hardstem and three-square bulrush, narrow-leaved cattail and arctic rush, growing on periodically saturated soils. Submergent and floating aquatic plants occur where water is deeper than 1.5 feet (0.5 m), and are characterized by pondweeds, bladderwort, water milfoil and water crowfoot.\n  \n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Meadows (Western Plateau and Canyon Regions)<\/span><span>\n Wet meadows often surround marshes, occupying saturated to moist soils. Plant species present reflect the degree of alkalinity or salinity. Where the sites are moderately to highly alkaline or saline, saltgrass, alkali sacaton, alkaligrass, alkali cordgrass, meadow foxtail, foxtail barley, three-square bulrush, sea-blite and arrowgrass are typically present. Moist to wet swales and seeps also support the characteristic plant species identified in the above discussion.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Riparian communities (Western Plateau and Canyon Regions)<\/span><span>\n Typically, riparian forests and shrubland communities of lower elevations of the Western Plateau and Canyon region occur on low terraces and floodplains. In the foothills, streams tend to be narrower with swifter flowing water.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Cottonwood\/willow forests<\/span><span>\n Riparian plant communities consist largely of deciduous forests on lower river terraces and floodplains, dominated by Fremont cottonwood in the lower elevations and narrowleaf cottonwood along moderate-gradient streams above about 6,000 feet (1829 meters) elevation.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Disturbed Habitat<\/span><span>\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Roadside habitat<\/span><span>\n Adjacent to road with management activities or other types of disturbance associated with roadsides.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Built habitat<\/span><span>\n Buildings and sealed surfaces, such as roads and parking lots\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Managed vegetation<\/span><span>\n Residential, commercial, and other regularly maintained green spaces\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ruderal Vegetation<\/span><span>\n Empty lots, abandoned farmland, and other green space that is highly disturbed but not managed\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Geology and Landform<\/span><span>\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Soils<\/span><span>\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Clay<\/span><span>\n Particle size is very small (<0.002 mm); use feel test to determine if clay.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Silt<\/span><span>\n Particle size is medium (0.002-0.05 mm); use feel test to determine if silt.\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Sand<\/span><span>\n Particle size is coarse (0.05-2 mm); use feel test to determine if sand.\n  \n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Gravel\/Pebbles<\/span><span>\n Loose aggregation of rock fragments, with relatively large (~ 1 cm) and coarse fragments\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Humus<\/span><span>\n Broken down organic material, decomposed leaves and other plant material\n  \n <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Fine<\/span><span>\n Squeeze a moistened ball of soil in the hand.
