The degree of dysfunction by ECMO is evaluated using several methods, namely: ultrastructural changes in gut epithelium by TEM, plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels of bacterial products after receiving ECMO, etc. In particular, bacterial lipoteichoic acid (LTA) antigens in plasma can be measured over time by Western\u00a0blot\u00a0laboratory technique in association with the loss of gut barrier function below. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate how newly-developed ECMO reduces infection levels by controlling and stabilizing the overall hemodynamic status, based on the outcome of a Western\u00a0blot.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9538","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1515631689","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Microbiology and Biomedical Science, Hanyang University College of Medicine and Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Seoul, Korea","affiliation":"Project nGene.org","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mjac4ie","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Hyunsuk-y2x244x2p2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/005.png","full_name":"Hyunsuk Roh","created_by":"Hyunsuk Roh","private_link":"D45CD32D0E4EFCAF03AA8B088EB392EB","original_img":"1","username":"hyunsuk-roh","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":279527,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Hyunsuk Frank Roh,Jung Mogg Kim","authors_list":[{"name":"Hyunsuk Frank Roh","affiliation":"Department of Microbiology and Biomedical Science, Hanyang University College of Medicine and Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Seoul, Korea","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Jung Mogg Kim","affiliation":"Department of Microbiology and Biomedical Science, Hanyang University College of Medicine and Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Seoul, Korea","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/005.png","username":"hyunsuk-roh","full_name":"Hyunsuk Roh","created_by":"Hyunsuk Roh"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"2","is_research":"1","status_info":"We are still developing and optimizing this protocol","steps":[{"id":"602452","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"C088AC73E91E4B48A848B9E233995828","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1515631843","components":[{"component_id":"1041393","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"6E0BD6FB229C40E692CBB8C6278FA7FB","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"(A) Cell Culture (SubCulture + Cell Counting)","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"(A) Cell Culture (SubCulture + Cell Counting)"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1041392","previous_id":"1041393","original_id":"0","guid":"09425B99D4B94D90992CB14207F3DAC6","previous_guid":"6E0BD6FB229C40E692CBB8C6278FA7FB","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<div title=\"Page 1\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Media: RPMI1640 to provide nutrition required for cell growth and to neutralize the trypsin<br \/> - Warm the media at 37 for 30 min;<br \/> - Prepare the trypsin (w\/ EDTA) and the PBS;<\/p>\n<p>- Suck away the media from the flask and then wash the cells (HT-29) with PBS (T- 25 = 5mL, T-75=10mL);<br \/> - Treat the cells with 1.0 mL of trypsin (w\/ EDTA) and incubate the flask at 37 for 5 min in order to separate the cells from the flask floor;<\/p>\n<p>- Prepare the materials (6 dishes, one 1.5mL tube for cell counting, 1 flask for cell subculture);<br \/> - After the incubation, add 4.5mL media to the previous flask;<br \/> - Take 5mL of the cells in the cube into the 15mL tube for centrifugation for 3 min at 1000RPM;<\/p>\n<p>- After centrifugation, remove the media (in case of cell counting, re-suspend the cells with 1mL of media, take 50uL and then proceed with cell counting);<br \/> - Afterwards, add 2mL of media, do pipetting up and down;<br \/> - For culturing, place 6.0*105 cells\/disk on each dish and a new flask for subculture.
