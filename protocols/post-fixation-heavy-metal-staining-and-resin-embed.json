Furthermore, these mini pins can be fitted to a microtome sample holder for trimming and sectioning as needed without risk to the trim tool or histology diamond knives. If the researcher decided to polymerize the sample in a traditional BEEM capsule or mold, then the final sample needs to be trimmed and exposed as routinely done in an EM sample preparation laboratory.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Tissues, cell monolayers, organoids and xenografts all image differently depending on the sample preparation method utilized. Moreover, the same tissue type from different species may also need different fixation solution and processing methods to have optimal contrast and charge mitigation when the same microscope is used (Borrett & Hughes, 2016; Kizilyaprak, Longo, Daraspe, & Humbel, 2015; Kopek et al., 2017). For example, brain tissue may be processed successfully using a protocol that yields poor images when applied to cancer tissues (unpublished data). Researchers are therefore encouraged to dive into the literature and test new sample preparation protocols for a specific sample-type. Also, and if available, having the ability to evaluate the use of FIB-SEM versus SBF-SEM will help the researcher to design a data collection strategy. The protocols evaluated during development of this workflow included the Dresden protocol (Paridaen, Wilsch-Br\u00e4uninger, & Huttner, 2013), Renovo (Mukherjee et al., 2016) and the Hua method (Hua, Laserstein, & Helmstaedter, 2015). We settled on the the Hua method with some modifications as described below, for human cancer biopsies. The final protocol described is sufficient for large format mapping and 3DEM FIB-SEM and SBF-SEM, eliminating the need for multiple samples processed with different protocols. In the case of biopsy tissue, where sample acquisition is limited and precious, flexibility is an important advantage of this workflow.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1574106276}
