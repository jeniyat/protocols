This system employs microfluidic channels that contain a bilateral constriction between the inlet and outlet electrode connections (<em>length<\/em>\u00a0= 3.0 mm, <em>width<\/em><sub>min<\/sub>\u00a0= 50\u00a0\u03bcm, <em>width<\/em><sub>max<\/sub>\u00a0= 2.0\u00a0mm, and <em>height<\/em>\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcm). The constriction amplifies the electric field under an applied voltage between the inlet and outlet electrodes to levels sufficiently high to induce electroporation. During <em>P. caudutus<\/em> transformations, the cells were driven through the microfluidic device at flow rates of 50\u00a0\u03bcL\/min and 500\u00a0\u03bcL\/min, which correspond to residence times (i.e. pulse durations) of 20\u00a0ms and 2\u00a0ms, respectively.\u00a0Square wave pulses with, for example, 5 ms ON and 5 ms OFF cycles (50\u00a0% duty cycle) are applied to the microchannel through the dispensing needle. Therefore the cell viability cannot be accurately evaluated since only 50\u00a0% of the cells experience the electric field. The pulses are delivered from electrodes with alternating polarity between the pulses to reduce electrolytic effects at the electrode-buffer interface (Fig. 1). After flowing through the microchannel, each 200 \u03bcL cell sample is added to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of fresh growth media for cell recovery. The applied voltages we evaluated had amplitudes of 250\u00a0V (<em>E<sub>max<\/sub><\/em>\u00a0=\u00a01,500\u00a0V\/cm), 375\u00a0V (<em>E<sub>max<\/sub><\/em>\u00a0=\u00a02,250\u00a0V\/cm), and 500\u00a0V (<em>E<sub>max<\/sub><\/em>\u00a0=\u00a03,000\u00a0V\/cm) for each polarity. The non-uniform constriction in the microfluidic devices generates a variable electric field that is capable of transfecting cells while minimizing exposure to the highest electric field.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1<\/strong>: Electric field waveforms employed for transient and stable transfection of <em>Bodo caudatus<\/em>.
