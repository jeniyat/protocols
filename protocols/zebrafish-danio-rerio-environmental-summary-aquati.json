In this year's version, we also include new information on our sanitization protocols and equipment.  We also provide some additional characterization of our sampling methods for water parameters and health in a legend.  This information will be applicable to any study involving zebrafish conducted in one of these three facilities during the year of 2018.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1546881828}
