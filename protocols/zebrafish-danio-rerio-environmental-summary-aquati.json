class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Environmental and housing conditions experienced by laboratory animals exert profound effects on their biology, physiology, and behavior.\u00a0 These parameters are important and often overlooked sources of potential variation in experiments, and should be reported in peer-reviewed publications in order to promote scientific reproducibility.\u00a0 To that end, here we provide a summary of the environmental conditions\u00a0in zebrafish (Danio rerio) aquaculture facilities at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH).\u00a0 \u00a0We include data on the physico-chemical, health, and nutrition of zebrafish in three separate facilities at BCH: Karp, Enders SSB, and Enders Lobby. In this year's version, we also include new information on our sanitization protocol validation, and dietary inputs.  We also provide some additional characterization of our sampling methods for water parameters and health in an updated legend. This information will be applicable to any study involving zebrafish conducted in one of these three facilities during the year of 2019.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1580484416}
