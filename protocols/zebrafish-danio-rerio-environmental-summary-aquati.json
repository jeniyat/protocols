animals exert profound effects on their biology, physiology, and behavior.\u00a0 These parameters are important and often overlooked sources of potential variation in experiments, and should be reported in peer-reviewed publications in order to promote scientific reproducibility.\u00a0 To that end, here we provide a summary of the environmental conditions\u00a0in zebrafish (Danio rerio) aquaculture facilities at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH).\u00a0 \u00a0We include data on the physico-chemical, health, and nutrition of zebrafish in three separate facilities at BCH: Karp, Enders SSB, and Enders Lobby.\u00a0 This information will be applicable to any study involving zebrafish conducted in one of these three facilities during the year of 2017.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9739","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1516411590","protocol_affiliation":"Boston
