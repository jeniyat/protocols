For detection, 0.5 g of tea sample was used. Then, 320 \u03bcL of 25%(w\/v) particle free paraformaldehyde solution (4% final concentration) was added, flled up with 1\u00d7 PBS, mixed up completely, and the suspension was stored at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. The fixed samples were washed twice with 1\u00d7 PBS, centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C after each washing, and stored in PBS\/ethanol (1:1) at \u221220 \u00b0C for further processing. Then, 100 \u03bcL of the fixed sample was diluted with 900 \u03bcL of PBS\/ethanol, and the mixture was dispersed by ultrasound with an ultrasonic probe at minimum power for 10 s using 1-s sonication pulses. Then, 20 \u03bcL of the sample was diluted in 10 mL of MQ water. This suspension was filtered through polycarbonate filters (0.2 mm pores, 25 mm in diameter). If the signal intensity is low, the tea sample dilution rate was reduced accordingly. After filtration, the filters were dipped in 0.1% low-melting point agarose and dried in an incubator at 46\u00b0C. The cell walls were permeabilized by addition of proteinase K solution (15 \u03bcg\/mL, Roche) and were then subsequently incubated in 3% H2O2 to inactivate endogenous peroxidases. Air-dried filters and cut filter sections were used for hybridization. Filter sections were placed in a 1.5-mL tube and mixed with 300 \u03bcL of hybridization buffer (10% (w\/v) dextran sulfate, 2% (w\/v) blocking reagent (Roche, Germany), 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% (w\/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.9 M NaCl, and 55% (v\/v) formamide) and 1 \u03bcL of probe working solution (final concentration 0.028 \u03bcM). The probes and their sequences are shown in Table 1. The nonsense probe NONEUB was used as a control. After hybridization at 46\u00b0C for at least 90 min on a rotor, the filters were transferred to prewarmed washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 5 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], and 3 mM NaCl, 0.01% (w\/v) SDS) and incubated for 15 min at 48\u00b0C; the samples were then mixed with 1000 \u03bcL of amplification buffer (1\u00d7PBS [pH 7.4], 0.1% (w\/v) blocking reagent, and 0.0015% H2O2,) and 1 \u03bcL of Alexa488 Tyramide (molecular probes, Life TechnologiesTM). Then, the filter sections were incubated in amplification buffer at 46\u00b0C for at least 20 min in the dark. Afterwards, the filters were stained with DAPI and mounted with 5 \u03bcL droplets of antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Life TechnologiesTM). Cell counting was performed on 10 randomly selected micrographs that were taken with 20\u00d7 objectives (150,415 \u03bcm2), and the results were extrapolated to 1 g of tea. Automated counting was performed on micrographs that exhibited a high contrast between stained cells and background fluorescence with the image analysis software ImageJ.","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"All samples for FISH were collected at different time of tea fermentation and stored on dry ice during transportation.
