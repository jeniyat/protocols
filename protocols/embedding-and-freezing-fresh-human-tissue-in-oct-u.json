class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">For many cutting-edge spatial transcriptomic analysis methods, it is essential to prepare and store tissue in a manner that preserves RNA integrity, tissue morphology, and spatial orientation.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol describes the process of freezing fresh or fixed and cryoprotected tissues in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) using an isopentane-dry ice slurry. Rapid controlled freezing preserves RNA and mimises ice damage, while embedding in OCT prepares tissues for future cryosectioning.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1575494767}
