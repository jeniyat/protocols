The new nest (NN) was placed 800 mm away from the front of the old nest (ON). The rectangular box around the ON depicts the Petri dish used to cover the ON during the tracking of each tandem run. L-tr: leader\u2019s tandem run path; L-rtn: leader\u2019s return path; F-tr: follower\u2019s tandem run path; F-rtn: follower\u2019s return path. The return paths of former leaders and followers were tracked with a motorized gantry in alternate tandem runs. During the L-P treatment, the arena was surrounded with a white muslin cloth to bar access to celestial cues and external landmarks.<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"908454","previous_id":"908455","original_id":"0","guid":"72F879372C084A3FA2042FAF2995516E","previous_guid":"7B6D8D68E64C4B20AF9C4E3F80FA954A","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Experimental protocol","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Experimental protocol"},"is_project":0}]}]}
