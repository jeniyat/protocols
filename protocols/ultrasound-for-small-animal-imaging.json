Specific details (eg. weight, DOB, sex, strain) of animal used for experiments are recorded on each report.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">B. Animal Anesthesia: Place the animal in the induction chamber and set oxygen level to 1-1.5L\/minute and the Isoflurane to 1% followed with increamental increases of 0.5 % to 3.0 % to induce total anesthesia for knockdown. (As indicated by pedal response)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">C. Re-direct the Isoflurane (anesthesia) through the hose to the mask and reset the Isoflurane level for maintenance to 1.5-2.0 % for obese animals, 1.0-1.5% for lean. Animal is immobilized during the course of the experiment with light anesthesia. Level of anesthesia is determined via pedal response.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">D. The animal is moved to the animal handling platform with the snout in the anaesthesia mask.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">E. Carefully place a small amount of corneal lubricant to each eye with the sterile cotton tip applicator.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Place a drop of gel onto each ECG connector on the handling platform and contact pads with the dermatological 3M tape.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">F. The ECG threshold control is used to adjust the display of ECG and heart rate, respiration on screen.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">G. Shave the area of interest then apply depilatory cream to remove the hair from the animal.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">H. Remove the cream after 1 minute. Ensure all the cream is removed with a water wash and pat dry.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">I. Use the gel warmer to heat the gel to 37\u00b0C, so the animal\u2019s temperature will not drop when the gel is placed on the skin.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">J. Place warmed ultrasound gel on the area of interest.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">K. Clean and disinfect the rectal probe and cover with lubricating gel. Advance temp probe slowly 3-5mm into the rectum and secure with the 3M tape.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">L. Attach the Scanhead to the rail system and mount above the animal. (Vevo\u2122 Integrated Rail System II Operator Manual, 4099A Katz).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">M.

An imaging session takes 10-30 minutes, depending on required views, for a complete procedure.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">P. Physiological parameters are recorded with the images during the course of the experiment, so the animal is closely monitored throughout.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Q. Remove the Ultrasound gel from the animal. Clean the shaved area with a warm damp gauze then pat area dry.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">R. Carefully remove the temperature probe and tape that is securing the animal to the platform.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">S. Turn off the anaesthetic and remove the nose from the mask.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">T. Weigh the animal on scale and record.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">U .
