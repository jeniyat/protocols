Episodic future thinking (EFT), the ability to project oneself into the future, is an intervention designed to reduce DD. EFT has reliable effects on DD, but the size of the effect varies, which could be due in part to the use of different control groups. Episodic recent thinking (ERT) serves as a common control for many EFT studies, but the temporal window of \u201crecent\u201d cues ranges from 24 hours ago to 12 days past. Since prior research has shown that retrospection can lead to prospection, it may be important to ensure that EFT controls do not inadvertently lead to prospection for some participants thereby increasing the variability of the control condition. The present study sought to develop a comparison group that standardizes the time frame and experiences that are the basis for the recent thinking control.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods: <\/span><span>Participants (n=53, 18-45) were randomized to one of three conditions: EFT, ERT, or standardized episodic thinking (SET).
