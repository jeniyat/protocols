[8]. The \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme (2 U\/mL) was premixed with 20 \u00b5L of plant aqueous extract at a concentration of 1,000 \u00b5g\/mL and incubated for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C. Then 1 mM p-nitrophenyl gluco-pyranoside (pNPG) (20 \u00b5L) in 50 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was added to initiate the reaction. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 \u00b5L of 1 mM sodium carbonate. The \u03b1-glucosidase activity was determined at 405 nm. The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity was calculated using the formula (Ac<sup>+<\/sup>) \u2013 (Ac<sup>-<\/sup>) \u2013 (As - Ab)\/(Ac<sup>+<\/sup>) \u2013 (Ac<sup>-<\/sup>)\u00d7 100, where Ac<sup>+<\/sup>, Ac<sup>-<\/sup>, As, Ab are defined as the absorbance (405 nm) of 100% enzyme activity (only solvent with enzyme), 0% enzyme activity (only solvent without enzyme), test sample (with enzyme), and a blank (a test sample without enzyme), respectively. Reagents to evaluate anti-diabetic activity were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For anti-diabetic activity, acarbose (anti-diabetic drug) was used as control.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"1","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"15376","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1536113992","protocol_affiliation":"Universidd Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.s9qeh5w","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t25433t2w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_document.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/003.png","full_name":"Maira Rubi Segura Campos","created_by":"Maira Rubi Segura Campos","private_link":"1EB6D77C12E8386C0227164EE53F0173","original_img":"1","username":"maira-rubi-segura-campos","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Dineshkumar B, Mitra A, Manjunatha M.
