After that, the cells may undergo additional seleciton while the population expands. At this time, some researchers reduce the concentration of the antibiotic in culture, or remove the antibiotic entirely. If the antibiotic is reduced or removed from the culture, check the cells regularly to confirm transgene expression.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><\/ul><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":"","affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":772707,"guid":"3CB6CA309A0F11E9B28BDDA0C1FF72C1","previous_id":772706,"previous_guid":"F9F937F09A0E11E9B28BDDA0C1FF72C1","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"039274F4D77F48168796C51F79D425D6","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Selection"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"1F7DA613135144E49677475C35BF13BD","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>As polyclonal populations of resistant cells start coming through and the individual wells become confluent, expand into larger vessels.

This is because lentiviral integration is random. Given the MOI of the lentivirus used, cells may also exhibit varying numbers of integration events. In other words, if an MOI > 1 was used, some cells may have 1 copy of the transgene, while others have >1 copy of the transgene in their genome. This can result in varying expression levels of the transgene from different cells in the population.<\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":"","affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":772708,"guid":"53E898509A0F11E9B28BDDA0C1FF72C1","previous_id":772707,"previous_guid":"3CB6CA309A0F11E9B28BDDA0C1FF72C1","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"BFB716CCF9C9442A9D2C0B8FC9CF263B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Selection"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"A46B202070A64C6E988C15FEBDE8E518","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Once the polyclonal populations are growing well and have been sufficiently expanded, prepare cell stocks and\/or harvest to test for protein expression.<\/div><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"34EDCDA6726C483A9338F4806267A8BC","order_id":2,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Typically cells transduced with lower dilutions of the virus will have higher levels of expression.
