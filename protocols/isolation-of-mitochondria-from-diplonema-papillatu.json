conditions may require optimization. Variables, known to influence the yield of cells and of mitochondria, include both the sea salt batch\/manufacturer, the horse serum batch\/manufacturer, and the presence of tryptone instead or in addition to yeast extract.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Avoid salt precipitates in the OS solution, as these tend to inhibit <em>Diplonema<\/em>'s growth. If present after autoclaving, let the precipitates sediment and decant the medium into a new sterile bottle.<\/li>\n<li>In order to sufficiently aerate the culture, the ratio Air:Medium in the flask\/container should be at least 3:1. The optimal cell culture conditions are achieved when the height of the medium in the flask\/container is 1-2 cm. Cultivation in tall flasks with small surface is not recommended, because it requires vigorous shaking to sufficiently aerate the culture, which in turn leads to higher amount of damaged cells and hampers isolation of intact sub-cellular fractions. Oven-sterilized large-surface glass bakeware works well. (Note that\u00a0cells can stick to the surface of some glass types; <em>Pyrex<\/em> glass is among the least sticky with <em>Diplonema<\/em>.)<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>When washing cells, solubilization\u00a0by gentle vortexing or hand-swirling is recommended instead of pipetting to avoid breaking cells' flagella. Resuspending only a single\u00a0aliquot (to be opened in the cavitation instrument) at a time can prevent cell autolysis during extended incubation in ice-cold SoHE.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Optimize the stirring conditions (size of the stirring bar, speed, position on the magnetic stirrer) before the isolation to ensure that the solution\u00a0in the nitrogen cavitation pressure chamber is properly mixed\u00a0when the chamber is closed.<\/li>\n<li>To avoid repeated thawing\/freezing cycles of the samples, either perform the final spin in 1.5-mL tubes, or distribute the final mitochondrial pellet into several 1.5-mL tubes.<\/li>\n<li>Keep small aliquots (at least 200 \u03bcL in case of a large-scale prep) of all isolation fractions, i.e., cells before breakage, cells after breakage, supernatant after ultracentrifugation, supernatant\/36% sucrose band, 36%\/60% sucrose band, supernatant after the wash of the 36%\/60% sucrose band, and final mitochondrial pellet. These are used to verify the efficacy of the procedure and the enrichment of mitochondria with a method of choice (e.g., extraction of mtDNA, extraction of total RNA, measurement of enzymatic activities, Western blotting, etc.).
