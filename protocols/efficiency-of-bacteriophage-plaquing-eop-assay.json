Set OD of each strain to 0.3 and add 250 \u00b5L of this suspension to a 15-mL Falcon tube (0.5 OD x 200 \u00b5L has also worked well).<\/li>\n<li>Add 5 mL molten agar to each tube, mix thoroughly but gently (avoid bubbles) by inversion.

Check plates for plaques and image using an iPhone (or appropriate substitute). Count isolated plaques and record.<\/li>\n<li>To convert plaque numbers to PFU\/mL, multiply the number of isolated plaques by the inverse of the dilution factor (ie. If 5 plaques are recorded on the -4 dilution spot, multiply 5 by 10<sup>4<\/sup>, then multiply this number by 100 to account for pipetting only 10 \u00b5L \u2013 this would give 5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> PFU\/mL). Shortcut: number of plaques (5, in this example) x 10<sup>(dilution number plus 2)<\/sup> = 5 x 10<sup>(4+2)<\/sup> = 5.0 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> PFU\/mL.<\/li>\n<li>Graph PFU\/mL vs. <em> jejuni <\/em>strain to compare plaquing efficiency of a phage on multiple strains.
