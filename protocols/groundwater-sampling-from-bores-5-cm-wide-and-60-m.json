The method was used in my PhD research on aquifer microbial ecology over two weeks at the Wellington Research Station in New South Wales, Australia. With a little practise, the method can probably be carried out solo by most people, although additional assistance would certainly speed things up. I managed to consistently sample and process groundwater from eight bores a day using this method; your mileage may vary depending on number of workers, distance between bores, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The sampling protocol describes the use of an inertia pump for bores with an internal diameter of approximately 5 cm and a sampled depth of less than 60 m. It includes the measurement of bore information - such as depth and water table - as well as the use of water meters to measure the pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and conductivity of groundwater, and of course the collection of the groundwater sample itself.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Separete protocols will be provided for sampling narrow-diameter bores, sampling stygofauna, sampling surface soils, conducting colorimetric analysis of ferrous and sulphide anion concentrations, and further post-processing and analyses of the groundwater samples collected in this protocol.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<ul>\n<li>Make sure the sample containers are clean and (preferably) sterile.

A spare foot valve is also recommended because abrasion against bore casings can wear holes in the housing and, in rare circumstances, they can also fall off.<\/li>\n<li>A variety of sampling hose lengths can also be useful - a long hose for sampling the deepest wells (the PP1 can sample down to about 60 m) and shorter lengths which are easier to handle and more practical for sampling shallower wells.<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes bores drilled into well-consolidated fractured rock aquifers are left un-cased. This causes very rapid wear on the foot valve and parts of the sampling hose. It can be prudent to carry additional spares for this eventuality, and to sample them last if that is an option.<\/li>\n<li>The Enviroequip Aqua Dipper Pro appears to be a localised rebranding of - or at least substantially similar to - the Heron Water Tape.<\/li>\n<li>We used the HACH-approved calibration standards for the pH and DO probes but it is sometimes acceptable to use alternatives.<\/li>\n<li>You will also need a range of replacement and alternative fittings which connect the sampling hose with the flow splitter, and the flow splitter with the flow cells. A well-stocked maintenance kit including various types of tubing, adapters, o-rings, tube clamps, duct tape, a sharp knife, and other such supplies is recommended.<\/li>\n<li>It's particularly useful to use rather long (&gt;2 m) lengths of tubing for connecting the flow cell with the flow splitter, and also for the flow cell outlet. This allows relatively free movement of the sampling hose and redirection of flow cell outflow to various containers without also having to move the flow cell apparatus itself.<\/li>\n<li>We used domestic bleach to make up a sodium hypochlorite solution (used to sterilise the sampling equipment). The cheapest domestic bleach is actually preferable, because it tends not to contain surfactants or other chemicals which could leave a residue.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000;\">Larger-volume sample containers may be necessary if your groundwater is particularly low-biomass.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000;\">Make sure the portable cooler is large enough for ice and for the maximum number of samples you expect to collect in a single session.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000;\">Purge water should be stored in containers during sampling so it does not re-enter the groundwater. Some published guidelines (e.g. <\/span><\/span>Sundaram, B. <em>et al.<\/em>, 2009. <em>Groundwater sampling and analysis: A field guide<\/em>) recommend purging at least three bore volumes of water, although pumping should continue until the water meter readings are stable. Knowing this, and with\u00a0<em>a priori<\/em> knowledge of the dimensions of the bores you plan to sample, you can calculate the container size(s) necessary for storing purge water. You may need to record the volume of purge water at close intervals (e.g. &lt;5 L), so gradation markings are useful.<\/li>\n<li>The gentler angles of a Y-shaped flow splitter should provide less resistance and more efficient pumping than a T-shaped splitter. Either way, make sure each outlet has an independent flow control valve.
