The present study aims to explore the relationships which exist between the subjective perception of some parental behaviour and the anxiety and avoidance dimensions of attachment during emerging adulthood. The results revealed that perceived family support and perceived parental warmth were negatively associated with the avoidance and anxiety dimensions. In contrast, perceived parental control (both behavioral and psychological) was found to be positively associated with both attachment dimensions. Perceived behavioral control was also found to play a moderator role between perceived parental warmth and romantic attachment anxiety. This research therefore adds to our knowledge of how to help young people establish healthy romantic relationships, one of the principal developmental tasks of emerging adulthood, and does so by analyzing the role played by the family in this undertaking. Indeed, the family continues to be a key development context for young people and influence them on the romantic partner choice. Young people who, in both Spain and many other Western countries, continue to live in the family home until well into their third decade of life. This is a new phenomenon which previous generations did not experience, and further study is required to enable a more thorough understanding of this period.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1570095399}
