It further examines the risk factors for intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction among these professionals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methods<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Convenience sampling was sourced from six health centers supervised by the Macau Health Bureau, namely, the Coloane Health Center, Coloane Shek Pai Wan Temporary Health Center, Taipa Elderly Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital, Macau Sino-Portuguese Nurses Association, Macau Association of Medical Volunteers and the Macau Surgical Association. <strong>Design<\/strong>: This study uses a cross-sectional self-administrative survey. <strong>Instruments:<\/strong> The study used case studies research instruments for workplace violence in the health sector by country (from the ILO, ICN, WHO, PSI) and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire and Perceived Stress Scale. The data collection period spanned from August to December, 2014. <strong>Data analysis<\/strong>: Multiple logistic regression examines levels of intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction in physicians and nurses and significant correlates affecting their job satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A total of 720 (14.9% physicians) participants were recruited. Worry about WPV, on-call duty and shift work, experience of bullying and verbal abuse and employment sector emerged as significant correlates affecting the intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of physicians and nurses. Working on the frontline, being aged 30 to 39, coming from an ethnic minority, and perceived stress were significant correlates affecting nurses\u2019 job satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WPV remains a significant concern in healthcare settings in Macau. Healthcare professionals should deploy protective strategies to combat the negative psychological effects of WPV. Stakeholders should legally enforce a zero-tolerance policy towards WPV within healthcare workplaces. The perpetrators of WPV should be told that violence will be deemed a violation of human rights and not tolerated, not least on account of how WPV is detrimental to healthcare professionals\u2019 mental wellbeing, risking irreversible physical and psychological harm for its victims.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keywords: <\/strong>Workplace Violence, Physicians, Nurses, Job satisfaction, Occupational health, Macau<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"15480","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1536562850","protocol_affiliation":"School of Nursing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong,Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.tcyeixw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"4303a4v2r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/009.png","full_name":"Teris cheung","created_by":"Teris cheung","private_link":"2D1795A43C83EC60946E4252340000B2","original_img":"1","username":"teris-cheung","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":353722,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Workplace Violence, Physicians, Nurses, Job satisfaction, Occupational health, Macau","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Teris cheung,Paul H.
