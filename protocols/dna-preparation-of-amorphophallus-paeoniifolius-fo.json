Nicolson) are important foods in the local diet in many Asian regions. The crop has high productivity and wide agroecological adaptation and exhibits suitability for the agroforestry system. Although the plant is assumed to reproduce via panmixia, a comprehensive study on the genetic background across regions to enhance wider consumer palatability is still lacking. Here, ten informative microsatellites were analyzed in 29 populations across regions in India, Indonesia and Thailand to understand the genetic diversity, population structure and distribution to improve breeding and conservation programs. The genetic diversity was high among and within regions. Some populations exhibited excess heterozygosity and bottlenecking. Pairwise\u00a0<em>F<\/em><sub><em>ST<\/em><\/sub>\u00a0indicated very high genetic differentiation across regions (<em>F<\/em><sub><em>ST<\/em><\/sub>\u00a0= 0.274), and the Asian population was unlikely to be panmictic. Phylogenetic tree construction grouped the populations according to country of origin with the exception of the Medan population from Indonesia. The current gene flow was apparent within the regions but was restricted among the regions. The present study revealed that Indonesia and Thailand populations could be alternative centers of the gene pool, together with India. Consequently, regional action should be incorporated in genetic conservation and breeding efforts to develop new varieties with global acceptance.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"5723","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1503586879","protocol_affiliation":"Bogor Agricultural University","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jjdcki6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2y284v2s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/m56fw26.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"edi santosa","created_by":"edi santosa","private_link":"873307CA0447E9ADE224806A96F714F2","original_img":"1","username":"edi-santosa","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Santosa E, Lian CL, Sugiyama N, Misra RS, Boonkorkaew P, Thanomchit K (2017) Population structure of elephant foot yams (<em>Amorphophallus paeoniifolius<\/em>\u00a0(Dennst.)
