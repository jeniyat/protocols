Following fixation (immersion or perfusion), rinse tissue in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1M, pH 7.3) containing 5, 10, and 20% sucrose for 24 hours per step or until the tissue \"sinks\u201d to the bottom of the container or tube. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The final sucrose concentration in the tissue may vary from 5-30% depending on what conditions work best for the tissue in question. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2.   Cool 2 methyl-butane in a dry ice bath until dry ice no longer boils when added. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3.   Make embedding molds out of aluminum foil. Cut small squares, about 1\u201d square or less. Use the bottom of a small glass vial or appropriately sized mold, form foil squares around bottom. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4.   While foil is still on the mold, write all information concerning the tissue going in the mold. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5.   Remove foil from mold, add OCT. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">6.   Take tissue out of 20% sucrose and place in a small dish or weigh boat containing OCT to remove any excess sucrose. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7.   Place tissue in foil mold. Make sure all tissue is flat on the bottom of the mold. Cover tissue with OCT. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">8.   Using forceps, hold mold in 2-methyl butane until OCT freezes. Try not to drop the mold in the 2-methyl butane, as the block will freeze too fast and crack. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">9.   Keep in bucket on dry ice until all blocks are ready to be put in \u201320\u00baC or \u201380\u00ba C freezer.Fold excess foil over the top of the block to prevent freeze-drying. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Procedure: Fresh Tissue <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Blocks of fresh tissue may be snap frozen at approximately -40\u00ba C and immediately sectioned on the cryostat or covered in OCT, snap frozen and stored at for later sectioning. The freezing temperature is critical, the slower the tissue freezes, the more ice crystals form. If the piece of tissue is very large there is a risk of it shattering if frozen too fast. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0}],"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><\/div>","changed_on":1557331110}
