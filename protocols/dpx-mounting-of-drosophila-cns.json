To improve the chemical tagging of neurons, we synthesized and evaluated new fluorophore ligands based on Cy, Janelia Fluor, Alexa Fluor, and ATTO dyes and tested these with recently improved <em>Drosophila melanogaster<\/em> transgenes. We found that tissue clearing and mounting in DPX substantially improves signal quality when combined with specific non-cyanine fluorophores. We compared and combined this labeling technique with standard immunohistochemistry in the Drosophila brain.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p><strong>Reagents and Supplies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corning dropping bottle (125 mL) with bulb and pipet.
