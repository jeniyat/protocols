Using a bootstrap technique in the selected sample size with 70 lines, the software resampled the thickness values 2,000 times. From a Gaussian distribution adjustment curve to the epidermis measurement, the peak was the thickness value, and the full with a half-maximum area was the sigma error value.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<div title=\"Page 12\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Preparation of the probe.\u00a0<\/p>\n<div title=\"Page 12\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Mounting the water barrier of the probe.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"118994","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"double distilled water (ddH2O)","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"120471","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Gel for ultrasound","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"","reagent_url":"","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":"<div title=\"Page 6\">According to the Instruction Manual of the equipment manufacturer, the performance of DERMALAB\u00ae SERIES SKINLAB USB may be affected if it is being used outside the range 10\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C (50\u00b0F to 95\u00b0F).<\/div>\n<div title=\"Page 6\">The high-frequency ultrasound needs to be connected to a computer.<\/div>","version_class":"10438","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1519554556","protocol_affiliation":"Postgraduation Program of Women\u2019s Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil,Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.nfgdbjw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2z2c443t2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/tudjbaw.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Zilma Reis","created_by":"Zilma Reis","private_link":"A00F4E4235EECFDAE6E78C79E9DD34CA","original_img":"1","username":"zilma-reis","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0196542","manuscript_citation":"Vitral GLN,  Aguiar RAPL,  Souza IMFd,  Rego MAS,  Guimar\u00e3es RN,  Reis ZSN (2018) Skin thickness as a potential marker of gestational age at birth despite different fetal growth profiles: A feasibility study.
