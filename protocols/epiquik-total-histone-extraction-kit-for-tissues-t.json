They act as spools around which<br \/>DNA winds, and also play a role in gene regulation.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>The core histones include H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histones undergo posttranslational modifications,<br \/>which alter their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. The H3 and H4 histones have long tails<br \/>protruding from the nucleosome, which can be covalently modified at several places. Modifications of<br \/>the tail include methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, citrullination, and<br \/>ADP-ribosylation (H2A can also be modified). Combinations of modifications are thought to constitute<br \/>a code, the so-called 'histone code.' Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as<br \/>gene regulation, DNA repair and chromosome condensation (mitosis).<\/p>\n<p><br \/>The EpiQuik\u2122 Total Histone Extraction Kit provides a simple and selective method for extracting<br \/>histone proteins used for a variety of applications, which include histone modifications such as<br \/>acetylation, methylation, and sumoylation. The EpiQuik\u2122 Total Histone Extraction Kit is also<br \/>specifically designed to meet the requirements of histone extracts used in EpiQuik\u2122 histone<br \/>quantification assays. The EpiQuik\u2122 Total Histone Extraction Kit can be used to extract histones from<br \/>mammalian cells and tissues. The EpiQuik\u2122 Total Histone Extraction Kit has the fastest procedure<br \/>available on the market, allowing completion within 60 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>PRINCIPLE &amp; PROCEDURE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The EpiQuik\u2122 Total Histone Extraction Kit simply applies our proprietary histone isolation buffers to cells or tissues. After treatment with pre-lysis, lysis, and balance buffers, the total histones are easily extracted for immediate use or storage at proper conditions.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/e6gegr6.gif\" alt=\"Schematic procedure for using the EpiQuik\u2122 Total Histone Extraction Kit\" width=\"250\" height=\"399\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/e6gegr6.gif\" data-ofn=\"op0006schematic.gif\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Fig. 1<\/strong>.
