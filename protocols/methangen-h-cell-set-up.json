Titanium should be flamed to remove organics between use.  As a note, using an H-cell with crimp sealable ports one can also configure a port of a reference electrode to be compatible with the working chamber. I have not noticed any differences in the potentials monitored with either configuration, but there is higher likely hood (especially in high current density systems) of not properly referencing the working electrode environment.

This is different than other protocols I have seen but I feel it is more anaerobic and better for the PEMs. Autoclave with \u00be volume of component A (cover with a loose normal bottle cap) in the reactors. Autoclave component B Separately (usually autoclave all in first round but can aliquot in case of time restrictions. All reactors gassed with N2\/CO2 80\/20. Usually takes around 10 min to be anaerobic. Post purge Attach stoppers and open screw caps (red anaerobic for working electrode) and blue (smaller hole punch) for the counter\/reference. Place in the anaerobic chamber overnight. Run abiotic CV\u2019s DPV\u2019s etc.  6:Inoculating reactors: I perform the equivalent of a 10% biomass transfer for electrochemical experiments. From stationary phase methanol grown cultures (~OD600 1.0) I centrifuge 10 mL to add to electrochemical cells. I use a centrifuge in an anaerobic chamber. I do 6 2-mL aliquots and save one 2 ml sample for protein analysis. Each 2-mL aliquot is centrifuges at 8,000 G for 5 min. Spent media is removed. (This spent media can be added to a reactor as a spent media control. As a not I recommend centrifuging media longer as the cells do not all pellet in 5 min though the majority do, I have had a few spent media controls make methane) Cells are re-suspended in media from each electrochemical cell (I remove prior to resuspension with a syringe through one of the septa) and then reinjected via septa into the working electrode chamber. I have washed cells in the past, but have found that one wash is sufficient to remove spent media and additional washes usually result in stress on cells and\/or loss of biomass.  From this point I generally run chronoamperometry ~-500 mV SHE for at least 48 hours before performing any electrochemical experiments. If you are quantifying methane I suggest taking a time zero sample to control for background methane in chamber or dissolved in spent media.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":14400}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol outlines set up and use of H-cells in a three electrode set up.
