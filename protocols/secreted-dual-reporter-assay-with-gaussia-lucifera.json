It is based on\u00a0the naturally secreted luciferase from <em>Gaussia princeps<\/em> as the main reporter protein and a secreted version of the red fluorescent protein mCherry as internal standard. After first measuring mCherry fluorescence in the medium, an enzyme buffer with coelenterazine as substrate is added to the same sample to trigger a glow-type luminescence of the luciferase. The simple and cheap assay can easily be adapted to a variety of experimental situations\u00a0and\u00a0should be an attractive alternative to the currently available commercial kits for dual reporter protein assays.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p><strong><u>Required reagents:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opti-MEM (\"Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium, without Phenol Red\") from Life Technologies.
