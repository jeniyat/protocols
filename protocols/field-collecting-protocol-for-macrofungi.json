\"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The Sam Mitchel Herbarium of Fungi documents the diversity of \u201cmacrofungi\u201d in the Southern Rocky Mountain region. For the use of this collecting protocol, we use the definition of Mueller et al. (2007, Biodiversity Conservation 16:37-48) to define macrofungi as, \u201c...distinguished by having spore-bearing structures visible to the naked eye (mushrooms, brackets, puffballs, false-truffles, cup fungi, etc.)\u201d Macrofungal surveys and collections represent baseline data critical to understanding species diversity and distributions. To make macrofungal collections valuable for current and future research, both the physical specimen and all associated data must be of the highest quality. If we use flowering plants as an analogy, the macrofungal spore bearing structure (AKA basidiocarp or \u201cmushroom\u201d) is analogous to the fruit of a plant. Consequently, we tend to refer to the mushroom as the \u201cfruit\u201d of the fungus. The \u2018business end\u2019 of the fungus (ie. the leaves, stems, and roots) are in the form of myceliumwhich form underground or within the substrate the fungus is deriving nutrition from. Please note that this protocol focuses on the field collection process. In Appendix see Resources 1-2 for information about processing museum-quality specimens for fungal herbaria.The directions outlined in this protocol are designed to research quality mushroom collections. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1563460844}
