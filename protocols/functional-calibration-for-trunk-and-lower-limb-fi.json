The exact sensor orientation does not matter, i.e. they don't need to be put in the exact same way for each new experiment. However, the sensors should be placed such as to reduce soft tissue artefacts. A good example of soft tissue artefacts of the thigh can be seen at the beginning of the functional calibration for the hip ad\/abduction movement. Activation of the thigh muscles at the start of the movement are moving the inertial sensor visibly upwards.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a good location for the shank sensors is the tibial plateau, about 10-15cm below the knee, slightly medially.<\/p>","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"5681","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1499322236","protocol_affiliation":"1) Laboratory of Movement Analysis and Measurement, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. 2) Department of Orthopaedics, Balgrist University Hospital, University of Zurich, Switzerland. 3) Department of Sport Science and Kinesiology, University of Salzburg, Austria","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.itrcem6","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":"","profile_url":"x2y274x2u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/mauggwn.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Benedikt Fasel","created_by":"Benedikt Fasel","private_link":"69369FEFD6FCC02BAE1214FE47E546D8","original_img":"1","username":"benedikt-fasel","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Fasel B, Sp\u00f6rri J, Sch\u00fctz P, Lorenzetti S, &amp; Aminian K (2017). <em>Validation of functional calibration and strap-down joint drift correction for computing 3D joint angles of knee, hip, and trunk in alpine skiing<\/em>.
