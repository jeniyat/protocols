Briefly, fluorescently-stained samples are wetmounted directly onto slides for epifluorescence microscopy after an optional chemical flocculation concentration step used for samples with anticipated virus concentrations of &lt;5&times;10<sup>7<\/sup> viruses mL<sup>-1<\/sup> (samples with &gt;5&times;10<sup>7<\/sup>&nbsp;viruses mL<sup>-1 <\/sup>do not require this concentration step prior to analysis). Virus concentration in the wet-mounted sample is determined from the ratio of viruses to microsphere beads, which are added at a known concentration. This wet-mount method for enumerating viruses is significantly less expensive than the filter-mount method (i.e., the cost of microsphere beads per sample is ~500-fold lower than the cost of one filter per sample), and is appropriate for rapid, precise and accurate enumeration of aquatic viruses over a wide range of viral concentrations encountered in field and laboratory samples. The only limitation of this method is that samples with virus concentrations &le;1&times;10<sup>6<\/sup> viruses mL<sup>-1<\/sup> cannot be enumerated, as the abundance of viruses is too low for efficient enumeration.<br \/><br \/><br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/dfc2w6.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<p>Figure 1.
