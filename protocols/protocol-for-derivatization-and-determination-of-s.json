Difficulties in isolation, purification by professional methods and using costly equipment are the multiple challenges of characterizing the nature and properties of these important components of living cells. Several methods have been applied for the qualitative analysis of the carbohydrates. However, GC and GC-MS are the most appropriate techniques ever used to analyze complex structures of polysaccharide. Notably, so far, no commercial kit has been developed and offered, particularly for derivatization of polysaccharides. This study aims to confer a modified protocol for suitable derivatization of structurally unknown polysaccharides. The fungal exopolysaccharide from <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Neopestalotiopsis<\/span><span> sp. has been used as the sample in this study. The study has established the multiple manual steps of the alditol acetate derivatization.
