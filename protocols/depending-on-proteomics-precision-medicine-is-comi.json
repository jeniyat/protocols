For the first time, scientists have discovered a direct link between reprogramming of cholesterol metabolic pathways and hepatocellular carcinoma, capturing potential new targets for the precise treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Clinical trials have shown that even in radical surgery, a significant percentage of patients are at risk of recurrence and metastasis.

By inhibiting cholesterol esterase SOAT1, cholesterol levels on the plasma membrane can be reduced, and tumor cell proliferation and migration can be effectively inhibited.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">This is the first time the research team has found a direct link between reprogramming of cholesterol metabolic pathways and hepatocellular carcinoma in the world, confirming the important role of cholesterol esterase in liver cancer.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">What is the relationship between cholesterol and cancer? As the author of this paper, He Fuchu, the chief scientist of the Chinese Human Proteome Project and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained that there were some clues in the past, people think that drugs like cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as treatment of stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease and other diseases. The drug has some effects on the prevention and treatment of tumors, but there has been no clear conclusion. \"For the relationship between the abnormality of cholesterol metabolism and the occurrence and development of liver cancer, we have carried out a large number of experiments to verify that it is now a causal relationship.\"<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Not only that, but the researchers also verified that \"Avamaib\", an inhibitor of cholesterol esterase SOAT1, showed good anti-tumor effects in tumor xenograft models of liver cancer patients, and \"Ava Maibu\" is expected to become A potential targeted therapeutic for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have a poor prognosis.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\"Don't break\" medicine can be diagnosed and intervened<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">About Ava Maibu, it is also quite amazing. It was originally a drug used to treat atherosclerosis, and there is currently no drug. Jiang Ying, the first author of the thesis and a researcher at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences of the Academy of Military Sciences, introduced that more than a decade ago, during the development of this drug, both Phase I and Phase II clinical trials were validated, and the safety of clinical medication was no problem, but in Phase III clinical trials.

Secondly, the targeted intervention of patients with elevated cholesterol esterase SOAT1 by \"Avamaib\" can greatly improve the cure of patients with poor prognosis of early hepatocellular carcinoma. rate.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">This is also the direction they will focus on in the future.

The scientific community once thought that as long as this great plan is completed, the mystery of human life will be revealed. but it is not the truth.
