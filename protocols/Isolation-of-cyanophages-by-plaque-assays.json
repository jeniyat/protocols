Since then, this approach has been used successfully to detect and isolate a number of different phages infecting marine<em> Synechoccocus<\/em> and <em>Prochlorococcus<\/em> (e.g., Suttle and Chan 1993; Waterbury and Valois 1993; Wilson et al. 1993; Sullivan et al. 2003).<br \/><br \/>The advantages of this method are that results are easily interpreted as plaques formed on pigmented lawns can be easily identified. Since a plaque is the result of a single infection event, the virus can be easily purified and cloned.\u00a0The first part of the procedures described as follows: (1) preparation of base plates and (2) preparation of top agar\/agarose are applicable also for bacteriophage plaque assays.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"1512","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1441214404","protocol_affiliation":"Manual of Aquatic Viral Ecology","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.dqg5tv","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2v2b433v2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","full_name":"Amy Chan","created_by":"Amy Chan","private_link":"B1938914C628BCFDD76A134DB38B3C18","original_img":"1","username":"amy-chan","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":222867,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"45","group_uri":"verve-net","group_name":"VERVE Net","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/cdqcwwe.png","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"},{"group_id":"81","group_uri":"suttle-laboratory-of-marine-molecular-microbiology","group_name":"Suttle Laboratory of Marine Molecular Microbiology and Virology","group_logo":"","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[{"protocol_name":"Isolation and life cycle characterization of lytic viruses infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria","protocol_name_html":"Isolation and life cycle characterization of lytic viruses infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria","uri":"Isolation-and-life-cycle-characterization-of-lytic-dxq7mv","username":"amy-chan","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","full_name":"Amy Chan"}],"tags":[{"tag_id":"57","tag_name":"VERVE"}],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[[{"protocol_id":"1503","author_name":"Mathias Middelboe","affiliation":"Manual of Aquatic Viral Ecology","uri":"Base-agar-plates-dp75rm"},{"protocol_id":"1503","author_name":" Amy M.
