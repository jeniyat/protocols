There is a great similarity in composition and abundance of the diatom community among the sampled points., which resulted in the absence of a linear pattern of relationship with the distance between sampling points. We conclude that distance was not a factor of differentiation of Antarctic diatom communities associated with terrestrial green macroalgae. Suggesting that Antarctic environments may have unique characteristics with homogeneous abiotic factors, at least related to this substrate.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1566818129}
