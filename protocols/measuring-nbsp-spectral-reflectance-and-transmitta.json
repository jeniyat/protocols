This \"standard version\" of our\u00a0protocol describes\u00a0the common\u00a0case where an individual leaf is large enough to entirely cover the reflectance or transmission port of the integrating sphere. Briefly, six mature, healthy and sunlit leaves from a canopy plant are selected for measurements of adaxial reflectance and transmittance. Leaf scans\u00a0are referenced to a calibrated Spectralon\u00ae disk\u00a0and corrected for stray light to yield\u00a0NIST-traceable, high-fidelity leaf spectral reflectance and transmittance measurements.\u00a0Our leaf spectroscopy protocol builds from <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B58dyv8L3FpMNnFTSUV4eENzS28\/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that<\/a> of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cao.carnegiescience.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carnegie Airborne Observatory<\/a>, as well as from integrating sphere user manuals from two companies (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.asdi.com\/products-and-services\/accessories\/integrating-sphere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASD Inc.<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spectravista.com\/spheres\/reflectance-sphere\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SVC<\/a>).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<ol>\n<li>Consult the user manual of the spectroradiometer and the integrating sphere to set up the instrument.<\/li>\n<li>The instrument should be set up in the shade, sheltered as much as possible from the elements.<\/li>\n<li>All canopy plants selected for measurements should have already been tagged, identified, and georeferenced before spectroscopy measurements start.<\/li>\n<li>The spectroscopist should be positionned as close as possible to the sampled plants to minimise time from collection to measurement.<\/li>\n<li>The spectroscopist should be in a confortable\u00a0position and have enough room around the instrument to spread leaf samples around without the risk of mixing up individual leaves during handling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Six mature, fully-developped, healthy-looking leaves from the sunlit (&gt;3 h per day of direct sunlight) portion of the canopy are selected<\/strong> for spectral measurements from the bulk leaf sample (often one of a few branches).
