Puccia, UNIFESP, Brazil) was used throughout this work. Fungal yeasts, isolated from infected mice, were initially grown on solid modified YPD medium (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% casein peptone, 1.5% glucose, pH 6.3, 1.5% agar) at 36\u00b0C. Samples from these plates were transferred to 10 ml modified YPD liquid cultures and incubated at 120 rpm, in a rotary shaker, at 36\u00b0C for 5 days, until mid-exponential growth phase (OD600 = 2.0) was reached. At this point, cells were harvested by centrifugation for total RNA extraction.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">RNA extraction, library construction and NGS Sequencing<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">RNA was extracted as described by [1] and further purified with Qiagen RNeasy columns. Next, RNA samples were treated with RNAse-free RQ1 DNAse (1 unit\/\u03bcg of RNA), for 2 h, at 37\u00b0C and purified again in RNeasy columns. Total RNA was then quantified using a Quantus Fluorometer (Promega) and RNA integrity was assessed in a Bioanalyzer 2100 using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano chip. Samples showing RNA Integrity Number (RIN) \u2265 8.0, were selected for preparation of sequencing libraries, with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Preparation kit, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina, Inc.). Quantification of libraries using qPCR was done using a commercial kit (KAPA Library Quant kit, KAPA Biosystems) and a 7500 fast Real Time qPCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The standard curve was used to calculate the PCR efficiency, as well as molarity of the libraries, using KAPA\u2019s recommended curve to scale the quantification, based on average fragment size, previously determined in the Bioanalyzer run. In total, 10 different RNA libraries were prepared, with RNA samples derived from 10 independent cultures. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq platform (75 X 75 bp paired-end reads).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Bioinformatics analyses<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Raw sequencing data, in FASTQ format, was processed by a Galaxy Public Server, available at https:\/\/usegalaxy.eu. Initially, the libraries were submitted to quality control checking, using FastQC [2] and Trimmomatic was used to remove low-quality (Q<30) reads, adapters and other contaminant sequences [3]. Quality-filtered reads were then mapped to the latest version of the Pb18 reference genome, using HISAT2 [4]. StringTie [5] was then used to assemble the mapped readings into transcripts, using the de novo transcriptome reconstruction method, allowing identification of all transcripts present in each sample (including currently annotated genes, as well as newly identified elements and isomorphs). SringTie Merge was next used to combine redundant transcription structures, providing a non-redundant reference transcriptome, with unique identifiers. Cufflinks [6] was next used to estimate expression values (FPKM) for each element in the StringTie-generated reference transcriptome. Transcriptome completeness was assessed using the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) software, version 3.0 [7]. Finally, transcripts were classified into different Transcription Class Codes (TCCs), reflecting their respective nature\/origin, with the aid of Cuffcompare [6], using a GFF3 reference annotation file for the Pb18 genome, downloaded from NCBI (see Table S1, spreadsheet 1 for details). The final dataset obtained from the analyses with StringTie\/Cufflinks\/Cuffcompare was filtered by expression level and by TCC, as suggested elsewhere [8, 9, 10, 11], so that only elements belonging to TCCs \u201c=\u201d, \u201cj\u201d, \u201cu\u201d and \u201cx\u201d, and displaying FPKM \u2265 1 were considered real transcripts and used in subsequent analyses.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Transcripts belonging to TCCs \u201c=\u201d and \u201cj\u201d were annotated using BLAST against the Paracoccidioides-specific database ParaDB [12], using an E-value \u2264 e-10 as cutoff for identification. Transcripts classified as \u201cu\u201d and \u201cx\u201d were evaluated for their respective coding potential with the aid of four tools: (i) Coding Potential Predictor (CPPred) [13], Coding Potential Calculator (CPC2) [14], Coding-Non-Coding Index (CNCI) [15] and Coding-Potential Assessment Tool (CPAT) [16]. Transcripts identified as having coding potential by any of these tools were tentatively identified using BLAST against the latest version of the NCBI nt database (V.20180122), using an E-value \u2264 e-10 as cut-off for identification. The remaining transcripts, identified as non-coding by all four prediction tools, were submitted to Infernal [17], for classification into the different families of non-coding RNAs defined in the Rfam database [18]. Finally, these putative ncRNAs were submitted to lncRNA extraction with the aid of FEElnc [19], which evaluated their potential nature as lncRNAs and identified their respective partner genes.<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/1089b2a9f6f5e4b347b34b209d7cbcefaae6daf12f68636bdfd9b4946c269d4d\/bxmgbbby7.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Jabes DL, de Freitas Oliveira AC, Alencar VC, et al.
