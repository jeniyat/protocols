Besides different pre-crops, the effects of soil management and fertilization on the fungal communities were investigated.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Due to different aspects of our protocol, we wanted to ensure reproducing a realistic ratio of the different fungal communities in the soils. The most important steps to\u00a0conform this demand being the frequently measurements\u00a0of DNA concentrations at different steps of the protocol, the high numbers of PCRs of each soil sample and the use of the qPCR setting a cut-off for the PCR cycles to\u00a0avoid an over-amplification of certain PCR-fragments and a loss of detectable biodiversity. The use of the two DNA isolation kits based on the cooperation with our project partner and the exchange of
