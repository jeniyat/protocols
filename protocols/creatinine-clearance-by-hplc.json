Wipe off any <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">excessive silicone and allow it to sit on bench to vent any fumes before assembling. This should be done periodically, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">but may last for months.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1. Assemble cage as described by instructions. Attach either the 15 ml fluid collector or 30 ml collector based on your <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">experience with the specific strain, size and number of mice you will place in cage. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2. Place food in feeder and attach. Mice must have food overnight especially diabetic mice. Place autoclaved tap water <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(distilled water is also OK but deionized water should not be used) in water bottle and attach. In non-diabetic mice, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">sugar water (3-5% glucose or sucrose water can be used to insure complete collection (i.e. enough volume).
