The 20 \u00b5l PCR reactions contained 2.0 \u00b5l 5\u00d7buffer, 1.6 \u00b5l 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 0.8 \u00b5l each of reverse (R) and forward (F) PCR primers (8 pM each), 0.2 \u00b5l of KOD Enzyme (1.0 U\/\u00b5l), and 20 ng of template DNA. PCR was performed under the following cycle conditions: initial denaturation of 94 \u00b0C for 5 minutes; followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C denaturation for 30 seconds, 55 \u00b0C annealing for 30 seconds, and 72 \u00b0C elongation for 40 seconds; followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The production fragment was sequenced with the following primers: L15869F and 80R for HVSI, 16539F and H719R for HVSII. The purified PCR products were sequenced by ABI 377 DNA automatic sequencer.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"6596","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1498625644","protocol_affiliation":"Feng-ling Xu, Mei Ding, Jun Yao, Zhang-sen Shi,Bao-jie Wang","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ipccdiw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2038433x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/007.png","full_name":"Feng-ling Xu","created_by":"Feng-ling Xu","private_link":"731D0FAED7C30E5E3E69983EC2B2A31F","original_img":"1","username":"fengling-xu","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0182769","manuscript_citation":"Xu F,  Ding M,  Yao J,  Shi Z,  Wu X,  Zhang J,  Pang H,  Xing J,  Xuan J,  Wang B (2017) Association between mitochondrial DNA variations and schizophrenia in the northern Chinese Han population.
