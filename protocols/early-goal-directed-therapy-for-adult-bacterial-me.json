It appears likely from our preliminary studies at QECH that delays in delivering essential care such as antibiotics and intravenous fluids are major contributors to the poor outcome. It is also likely that delays in reaching hospital care also contribute, although this has not been proven.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Applying EGDT to resource limited settings using existing treatments using targets is potentially achievable and has not been done in adult medicine in Africa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is very important to know if deficiencies in the existing healthcare structure contribute to poor outcome and if outcome can be improved by optimising care. By using the early goal directed target (EGDT) approach, we can test if through optimising existing resources and improving clinical care (by shortening assessment times and giving appropriate recognised treatments within a prompt timeframe) is achievable, and if any impact on outcome through this approach is possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summary of the clinical evidence to support each element of the care bundle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All elements of the bundle have strong evidence to support their use in ABM, and are based on the surviving sepsis guidelines (6). All have been adapted to be feasible in a low income setting. Airway management has been shown to reduce the risk of airway obstruction in coma (12-13), and is essential for a patient with seizures. Naso-pharyngeal airways are safest where invasive ventilation is not available. Cerebral oxygenation and perfusion are essential in ABM. A 30\u00b0C head tilt has been shown to optimise perfusion and minimise oedema in brain injury (14), and oxygen saturations of less than 93% were shown to be associated with an increased risk of death in an analysis of mortality from meningitis in Malawi (Wall, Cartwright et al 2010 unpublished). Early antibiotics in meningitis have been shown to have a significant association with survival in several studies (15-17). Fluid resuscitation in ABM is more controversial, as no RCTs have been performed to investigate this. Fluid restriction in children is associated with harm in meningitis, and initial aggressive resuscitation in adult sepsis is associated with survival (6, 18). Therefore if adults appear clinically shocked, they will be resuscitated with fluid, but if not they will receive maintenance IV fluids for the duration of the intervention.

It appears likely from our preliminary studies at QECH that delays in delivering essential care such as antibiotics and intravenous fluids are major contributors to the poor outcome. It is also likely that delays in reaching hospital care also contribute, although this has not been proven.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Applying EGDT to resource limited settings using existing treatments using targets is potentially achievable and has not been done in adult medicine in Africa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is very important to know if deficiencies in the existing healthcare structure contribute to poor outcome and if outcome can be improved by optimising care. By using the early goal directed target (EGDT) approach, we can test if through optimising existing resources and improving clinical care (by shortening assessment times and giving appropriate recognised treatments within a prompt timeframe) is achievable, and if any impact on outcome through this approach is possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summary of the clinical evidence to support each element of the care bundle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All elements of the bundle have strong evidence to support their use in ABM, and are based on the surviving sepsis guidelines (6). All have been adapted to be feasible in a low income setting. Airway management has been shown to reduce the risk of airway obstruction in coma (12-13), and is essential for a patient with seizures. Naso-pharyngeal airways are safest where invasive ventilation is not available. Cerebral oxygenation and perfusion are essential in ABM. A 30\u00b0C head tilt has been shown to optimise perfusion and minimise oedema in brain injury (14), and oxygen saturations of less than 93% were shown to be associated with an increased risk of death in an analysis of mortality from meningitis in Malawi (Wall, Cartwright et al 2010 unpublished). Early antibiotics in meningitis have been shown to have a significant association with survival in several studies (15-17). Fluid resuscitation in ABM is more controversial, as no RCTs have been performed to investigate this. Fluid restriction in children is associated with harm in meningitis, and initial aggressive resuscitation in adult sepsis is associated with survival (6, 18). Therefore if adults appear clinically shocked, they will be resuscitated with fluid, but if not they will receive maintenance IV fluids for the duration of the intervention.
