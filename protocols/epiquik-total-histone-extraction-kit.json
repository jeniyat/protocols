complete set of optimized buffers and reagents for extracting total core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) from mammalian cells or tissues\u00a0in a simple 60 minute procedure.\u00a0The post-translational modifications (PTM) in the histone extracts are kept intact and thus can be used with Epigentek's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epigentek.com\/catalog\/histone-modification.php\" target=\"_blank\">histone modification<\/a> assay kits\u00a0 or in a variety of downstream applications for histone\u00a0methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation,\u00a0sumoylation, ubiquitination,\u00a0citrullination, and ADP-ribosylation\u00a0\u00a0studies.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-optimized and simple 1 hour protocol.<\/li>\n<li>Conveniently includes all essential reagents to carry out a histone extraction.<\/li>\n<li>Standardized procedure for reproducible results.<\/li>\n<li>Extracts a high yield of total core histones from as little as\u00a01\u00a0mg of tissues.<\/li>\n<li>Post-translational modifications are kept intact.<\/li>\n<li>Does not affect histone modification status or
