It allows comparisons in the same indication, that allows quantitative BRA balances, is useful to shows results in a transparency and consistency manner and also to communicate easily to the stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>MCDA has emerged as a promising tool in the decision context for drugs, although its use has been relegated to assess drugs in the context of medicine reimbursment and a few for benefits, risks and others assessments in medicines for a particular indication. One of the major advantages of MCDA is the inclusion of criterian weights that is \"preferences\". this roadmap to formulate a MCDA compile the recomendations of IMI-PROTECT and ISPOR task force to easy, explicit and transparent election of criteria included in a MCDA.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9891","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1517311654","protocol_affiliation":"Hospital Internacional de Colombia, Neurociencias","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mwbc7an","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":"","profile_url":"y2y2c4v2s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","created_by":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","private_link":"C35A26FC0FBFB1EB2016309C5EB60A57","original_img":"1","username":"jose-mendozasanchez","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p><strong>Benefit, risk and cost of new oral anticoagulants and warfarin in atrial fibrillation; a Multicriteria Decision Analysis <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>","journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":287669,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[{"protocol_id":"9896","protocol_name":"Roadmap to formulate a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)","protocol_name_html":"Roadmap to formulate a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)","uri":"roadmap-to-formulate-a-multicriteria-decision-anal-mwgc7bw","full_name":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","affiliation":null,"affiliation_url":null,"username":"jose-mendozasanchez"}],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"MCDA, Benefit-Risk assessment","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[{"tag_id":"1504","tag_name":"MCDA"},{"tag_id":"1505","tag_name":" BRA"}],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","authors_list":[{"name":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","affiliation":"Hospital Internacional de Colombia, Neurociencias","username":"jose-mendozasanchez","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","username":"jose-mendozasanchez","full_name":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","created_by":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":"<p>IMI-PROTECT Benefit-Risk Group RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT; Recommendations for the methodology and visualisation techniques to be used in the assessment of benefit and risk of medicines<\/p>\n<p>Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis for Health Care Decision Making\u2014An Introduction: Report 1 of the ISPOR MCDA Emerging Good Practices Task Force<\/p>\n<p>Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis for Health Care Decision Making\u2014Emerging Good Practices: Report 2 of the ISPORMCDA Emerging Good Practices Task Force<\/p>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"605480","is_changed":0,"original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"2D8033BE63D44AE8B9DD041D66787114","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1517330430","components":[{"component_id":"1049231","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"223035A977DB4268A27739ABA7ED8632","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"planning (focus on critical issues)","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"planning (focus on critical issues)"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1049230","previous_id":"1049231","original_id":"0","guid":"16257264902345A383A1477877A96C06","previous_guid":"223035A977DB4268A27739ABA7ED8632","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>This stage encourages stakeholders to focus on critical issues related to benefit-risk assessment, including the purpose and context of the assessment.
