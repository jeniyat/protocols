It allows comparisons in the same indication, that allows quantitative BRA balances, is useful to shows results in a transparency and consistency manner and also to communicate easily to the stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>MCDA has emerged as a promising tool in the decision context for drugs, although its use has been relegated to assess drugs in the context of medicine reimbursment and a few for benefits, risks and others assessments in medicines for a particular indication. One of the major advantages of MCDA is the inclusion of criterian weights that is \"preferences\". this roadmap to formulate a MCDA compile the recomendations of IMI-PROTECT and ISPOR task force to easy, explicit and transparent election of criteria included in a MCDA.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"1","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9896","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1517334027","protocol_affiliation":"Hospital Internacional de Colombia, Cardiecol","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mwgc7bw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2y2c4v2s2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/017.png","full_name":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","created_by":"Jose Mendoza-Sanchez","private_link":"A18B97E7814A886E4E2C743BE1279265","original_img":"1","username":"jose-mendozasanchez","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0196361","manuscript_citation":"Mendoza-Sanchez J,  Silva F,  Rangel L,  Jaramillo L,  Mendoza L,  Garzon J,  Quiroga A (2018) Benefit, risk and cost of new oral anticoagulants and warfarin in atrial fibrillation; A multicriteria decision analysis.
