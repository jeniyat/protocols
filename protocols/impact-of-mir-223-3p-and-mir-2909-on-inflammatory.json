We used high-throughput miRNA microarray analysis to identify miRNAs that were significantly (p<0.05) differentially expressed during both acute and chronic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly(p<0.05)reduced the expression of miR-223-3P and miR-2909, while promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-1b, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4\/TLR2\/nuclear factor (NF)-kB\/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 signaling pathway in human adipose stem cells. Further, miR-223-3P expression was significantly(p<0.05) reduced in human adipose stem cells during activation by IL-6 stimulation. The inducible down-regulation of miR-223-3P resulted in the activation of STAT3, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">which was directly targeted by miR-223-3P. STAT3 directly targeted TLR4 and TLR2, promoting the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and formed a positive feedback loop to regulate IL-6 levels. Similarly, TNF-a significantly(p<0.05) increased the expression of miR-223-3p, with LPS and TLR4\/TLR2\/NF-kB\/STAT3 forming a negative feedback loop to regulate TNF-a levels. In addition, miR-2909, which depends on NF-kB, targeted Krueppel-like factor (KLF) 4 to regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a. We conclude that miR-223-3p and miR-2909 form a complex regulatory network with pro-inflammatory factors and signaling pathways in adipose stem cells stimulated by LPS. These findings will inform the development of therapies against autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.Establish an acute inflammation model of adipose stem cells<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2.Establish a chronic inflammation model of adipose stem cells<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3. miRNA microarray and data analysis<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4.Target gene prediction, gene ontology (GO) enrichment, and pathway analysis<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5.Prediction of target gene binding sites<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">6.Dual luciferase assay<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7.LPS induces STAT3mRNA and protein levels in adipose stem cells, and promotes STAT3 protein phosphorylation, while miR-223-3p regulates STAT3 mRNA<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">8.miR-223-3p directly regulates TLR2 and TLR4, and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">9.
