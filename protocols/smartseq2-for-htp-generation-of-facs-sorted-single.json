Most organs were sorted into 384-well plates using SH800S (Sony) sorters. Heart and liver were sorted into 96-well plates and cardiomyocytes were hand-picked into 96-well plates. Limb muscle and dia- phragm were sorted into 384-well plates on an Aria III (Becton Dickinson) sorter. The last two columns of each 384 well plate were intentionally left as blanks. For most organs, single cells were selected with forward scatter, and dead cells and common cell types were excluded with a single colour channel. Combinations of fluorescent antibodies were used for most organs to enrich for rare cell popula- tions (see Supplementary Information), but some were stained only for viable cells. Colour compensation was used whenever necessary. On the SH800, the highest purity setting (\u2018Single cell\u2019) was used for all but the rarest cell types, for which the \u2018Ultrapure\u2019 setting was used. Sorters were calibrated using FACS buffer every day before collecting any cells, and also after every eight sorted plates. For a typical sort, 1\u20133 ml of pre-stained cell suspension was filtered, vortexed gently, and loaded onto the FACS machine. A small number of cells were flowed at low pressure to check cell and debris concentrations. The pressure was then adjusted, flow paused, the first destination plate unsealed and loaded, and sorting started. If a cell suspension was too concentrated, it was diluted using FACS buffer or 1X PBS. For some cell types, such as hepatocytes, 96-well plates were used because it was not possible to sort individual cells accurately into 384-well plates. Immediately after sorting, plates were sealed with a pre-labelled aluminium seal, centrifuged, and flash frozen on dry ice. On average, each 384-well plate took 8 min to sort. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":741200,"guid":"1F1EBD587BB44970A8B2DD9CF3BF2517","previous_id":741199,"previous_guid":"43B9293C245C4023B3459B68C793326D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"3DC760219B154FCD98FE50219B1ACF18","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"cDNA Synthesis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"CE8859E52A8E4B94936EBB830EB32A22","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">First Strand Synthesis <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>cDNA synthesis was performed using the Smart-seq2 protocol<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">1<\/span><span>.
