There were six independent transformation trials carried out.

Also, H. akashiwo does not grow on solid medium, so transformants are grown 'in bulk' and cannot be considered clonal. The viability of transformants when treated with Hygromycin (between 10 \u03bcg\/ml and 20 \u03bcg\/ml) needs be reevaluated and the selection procedure may need further optimization as well.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":773249,"guid":"C8186A00AEC14A15AB0C25CD570408BD","previous_id":null,"previous_guid":null,"modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"546FDBFD63E24E4D984914FA52F975A3","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Preparing an Agrobacterium starter culture"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D4B3FA85F942419F9BCD46A3880D50C8","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Plant transformation binary vectors (here pCambia1300 and its variants) were introduced into <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Agrobacterium tumefaciens<\/span><span> (GV3101(pMP90)) via electroporation.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Cells were grown at 29 C for 2 days on agar-solidified LB (Luria-Bertani) medium with antibiotics (Kanamycin 50 \u03bcg\/ml; Rifampicin 25 \u03bcg\/ml; Gentamycin 25 \u03bcg\/ml).
