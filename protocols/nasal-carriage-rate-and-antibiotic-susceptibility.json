This study aimed to determine the prevalence of<\/p>\n<p>nasal carriage and antibiotic susceptibilities of meningococcal isolates from healthy Ethiopian<\/p>\n<p>children and adolescents.<\/p>\n<p><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/p>\n<p><u>Method<\/u>: A cross-sectional study was conducted in one of the sub-cities of Addis<\/p>\n<p>Ababa, Ethiopia. Nasal swabs were collected and processed for identification, serogrouping and<\/p>\n<p>testingsusceptibilities for three antibiotics using standard microbiological techniques. Data on<\/p>\n<p>epidemiologic risk factors were collected using a structured questionnaire and the magnitude of<\/p>\n<p>their association with carriage was assessed using bivariate and multivariate analysis.<\/p>\n<p><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/p>\n<p><u>Result<\/u>: A total of 240 samples were collected (115 from males and 125 from females). The<\/p>\n<p>mean age of study participants was 11.1 years. The prevalence of nasal carriage for <em>Neisseria <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>meningitidis<\/em> was 20.4% (49\/240). Carriage was significantly higher among children living under<\/p>\n<p>crowded conditions (OR1.268; 95% CI: 1.186 \u2013 1.355; p = 0.006). The predominant serogroups<\/p>\n<p>were W135 \u2013 20\/49 isolates (40.8%) and C - 12\/49 isolates (24.5%) and 83.7% of meningococci<\/p>\n<p>were sensitive for Ciprofloxacin. In contrast, isolates showed high resistance to Ceftriaxone<\/p>\n<p>(69.4%) while only 4.2% were sensitive for Penicillin. Multi-drug resistance was documented for<\/p>\n<p>14.3% of the isolates.<\/p>\n<p><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/p>\n<p><u>Conclusions<\/u>: Meningococcal carriage rate was found to be high with higher rates associated<\/p>\n<p>with children and adolescents living in crowded living conditions. Predominant isolates were of<\/p>\n<p>serogroup W135 and C and the isolates showed marked susceptibility to Ciprofloxacin and<\/p>\n<p>resistance to Ceftriaxone and Penicillin.<\/p>\n<p><u>\u00a0<\/u><\/p>\n<p><u>Keywords<\/u>: <em>N. meningitidis<\/em>, Nasal carriage, Antibiotic susceptibility, Serogroup, Children,<\/p>\n<p>Adolescents, Ethiopia<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"7363","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1502882046","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.jfbcjin","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2236433r2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","full_name":"Tinsae Alemayehu","created_by":"Tinsae Alemayehu","private_link":"15A7AD439C2532F840A29986FA9BC4C3","original_img":"1","username":"tinsae-alemayehu","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0187207","manuscript_citation":"Alemayehu T,  Mekasha A,  Abebe T (2017) Nasal carriage rate and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of <i>Neisseria meningitidis<\/i> in healthy Ethiopian children and adolescents: A cross-sectional study.
