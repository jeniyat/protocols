However, due to the lack of a suitable mouse model, scientists knew little about the causes of cytokine production.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Researchers from Italy used a humanized mouse leukemia model and found that the main cells that secrete IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines that cause CRS and neurotoxicity are not CAR-T cells but host monocytes. The use of tocilizumab to block IL-6 receptor activation or to eliminate host monocytes can prevent the production of CRS, but it does not prevent neurotoxicity from occurring. Tocilizumab is a drug that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and CRS produced by CAR-T therapy, but it is a relatively large protein that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, the production of IL-1 in the host was earlier than IL-6 production for several hours. In a mouse model, IL-1 can trigger the production of IL-6. This means that IL-1 is the main regulator that regulates IL-6 and other cytokines. The researchers found that the use of an IL-1 receptor antagonist called anakinra prevented both CSR and neurotoxicity. Anakinra is a drug that has received FDA approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is a smaller molecular weight peptide that crosses the blood-brain barrier.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Researchers from New York used another mouse model to show that IL-1 and IL-6 produced by host macrophages play an important role in causing CRS and neurotoxicity. Their research shows that the production of nitric oxide (NO) by host macrophages also plays an important role in triggering CRS. Moreover, anakinra is more effective than tocilizumab in preventing CRS, and it does not affect the anti-cancer effect of CAR-T therapy.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Next, researchers will examine the efficacy of blocking IL-1 signaling in the prevention and treatment of CRS in human patients.
