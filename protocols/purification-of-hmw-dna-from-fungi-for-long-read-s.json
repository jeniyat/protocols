PacBio and Nanopore, requires high molecular weight (HMW) and highly pure DNA. Many fungal and plant species have high content of polysaccharides and other contaminants that are co-precipitated with DNA during ethanol precipitation. This protocol aims to purify HMW DNA from the DNA solution obtained using Benjamin Schwessinger's protocol (dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ewtbfen).<\/p>\n<p>The protocol was tested fuccessfully in wheat leaf rust, barley leaf rust, wheat stem rust and myrtle rust.<\/p>\n<p>Critcal step to seperate HMW DNA from low molecular weight DNA and other contaminants during ethanol precipitation is to allow cotton-fiber-like HMW DNA to sediment by gravity, while other small molecule DNA and contaminants remain in the supernatant.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p><strong>Reagents required:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pectinase (Sigma P2611)<\/p>\n<p>RNAse A (QIAGEN 19101)<\/p>\n<p>Proteinase K
