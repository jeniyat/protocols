At the same time, prevention programs have resulted more successful in adolescent population than in older ages, yielding promising results regarding the reduction of aggressive behaviour. However, despite these encouraging results, evidence-based universal prevention programs are still scarce among the scientific community, particularly in Spain. This project aims to contribute to the body of knowledge of evidence-based interventions developing, implementing and evaluating the efficacy of a Cluster-Randomized Control Trial Dating Violence Prevention Program. The program will integrate the characteristics and peculiarities of the phenomenon when it happens in the teenage years; risk and protective factors of dating violence will be considered and included in the design of the intervention program; the program will involve school member staff and will be partially sustained on peer-led learning. The results of this study will contribute to increasing the number of evaluated prevention programs to reduce dating violence in adolescence, which may be used by teachers and policymakers. By doing this, the project is therefore expected to contribute to the scientific and educational community with a psychoeducational model that could be incorporated into the educational policies.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"materials_text":null,"warning":null,"version_class":"15840","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1537253227","protocol_affiliation":"Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology.
