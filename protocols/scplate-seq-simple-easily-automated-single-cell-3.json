Most involve either significant startup cost, an expert operator, or expensive library preparation. We developed a plate-based library prep that incorporates pre-amplification pooling, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), and mRNA enrichment using silanol coated magnetic beads. Our method, which builds off of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-017-00136-z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bush et al. <\/a>(Nature Communications, 2017) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/nprot.2014.006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Picelli et al.<\/a> (Nature Protocols, 2014), uses readily available equipment, is easy to automate,\u00a0and costs a fraction of\u00a0commercial kits. In addition, our method has been optimized to reduce barcode cross contamination that can occur in pooled pre-amplification reactions. This method allows for plate-based 3\u2019 scRNA-seq with UMIs at relatively low cost, using standard lab equipment.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NOTE (2018\/08\/29)<\/span>: we are currently testing optimizations\u00a0described\u00a0by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-018-05347-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bagnoli et al. <\/a>(<em data-test=\"journal-title\">Nature Communications<\/em>, 2<span data-test=\"article-number\">018).
