Can be used to analyze genomic and plasmid DNA, with PCR products up to 2 kb being no problem. It doesn't get easier than this: pick a small amount of cells from a plate into water, lyse cells at 99C for 5 min. Use the lysed cells as template by adding to 1\/10th\u00a0final volume in a PCR. We use this protocol for diagnostics (Phire HS II enzyme) and\u00a0for Sanger sequencing (Phusion HS II or NEB Q5 enzyme). The main reasons why others might not\u00a0get this protocol to work could be due to using too many cells and\/or not using pure water for the cell lysis. \u00a0Good luck, and have fun!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>See the 'BEFORE START' section of this protocol for photographs that show how to pick cells from a colony and make a suspension. \u00a0See the 'WARNINGS' section for\u00a0important points and trouble shooting.\u00a0<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>Below\u00a0are a few\u00a0photographs of picking cells from a colony and making cell suspensions.
