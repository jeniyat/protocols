The phage display system mimics the natural immune system, making it possible to model the in vivo antibody production process and build a library of high-affinity antibodies. Since the phage display technology realizes the efficient conversion of genotype and phenotype, the researcher can realize the in vitro control of protein conformation on the basis of gene molecular cloning, which provides a powerful means for obtaining expression products with good biological activity. In addition, phage display technology has become a new way to obtain specific human antibodies without immunization, providing an important means for obtaining monoclonal antibodies with diagnostic and therapeutic value for human and animal diseases.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Principles of phage display technology<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Phage display technology is a method for inserting a gene encoding a polypeptide or a protein into a phage coat protein structural gene, and making the foreign polypeptide or protein and coat protein in a correct reading frame without affecting the normal function of other coat proteins. Fusion expression, the fusion protein is displayed on the surface of the phage as it reassembles the progeny phage. The polypeptide or protein displayed on the surface of the phage maintains a relatively independent spatial structure and biological activity that can bind to and recognize the target molecule. The peptide library or protein library displayed by the phage is bound to the solid phase antigen, the unbound phage is washed away, and then the bound phage is eluted with acid-base or competitive molecules, and the neutralized phage is infected with E. coli to expand, after 3- Five rounds of enrichment gradually increase the proportion of phage that can specifically recognize the target molecule, and finally obtain a polypeptide or protein that recognizes the target molecule.

M13 phage display system The M13 phage belongs to the single-stranded circular DNA virus and has a genome of 6.4 kb, encoding 10 proteins, 5 of which are structural proteins, including PVIII of the major capsid protein and pIII, pVI, PVII and PIX of the minor capsid. Among them, pIII and PVIII are the two most commonly used proteins in phage display, and the pIII and PVIII display systems were constructed. The pIII protein has a molecular weight of 42 kDa and is distributed at one end of the phage particle. Typically, a phage has 3-5 copies of the pIII protein, and a foreign protein or polypeptide can be inserted at the N-terminal flexible junction. The main advantage of the pIII system is that there are no strict requirements on the size of the displayed foreign protein, which can be used to display larger molecular weight proteins. The PVIII protein has a molecular mass of 5.2 kDa and is mainly distributed on both sides of the phage particle. Due to the small molecular weight of this protein, it is only suitable for displaying exogenous short peptides. Too large a foreign peptide will affect viral packaging and will not form a functional phage. However, due to the high copy number of pIII protein, the system is more suitable for screening low affinity ligands.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">2. \u03bb phage is a mild phage of the long-tailed phage family, having an icosahedral head with a diameter of 55 nm and a slender tail at the end. The genome is a 48.5 kb linear double-stranded DNA molecule with a sticky end, ie a single strand extending 12 nucleotides, and the linear genome can be immediately circularized after infection. The head of the phage is composed of D protein and V protein, and a display system of D protein and V protein can be constructed. \u03bb phage is assembled in the host cell, and it is not necessary to secrete foreign peptides or proteins into the bacterial cell membrane. It can display active macromolecular proteins (proteins above 100 kDa) and toxic proteins in host cells.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">3. T4 phage display system<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The T4 phage genomic DNA is double-stranded and arranged in a circular shape. The phage capsid has two non-essential coat proteins: SOC (small outer capsid protein) and HOC (highly antigenic outer capsid protein). The T4 phage surface display is a fusion of a foreign polypeptide or protein to the C-terminus of the SOC site and the N-terminus of the HOC site, respectively, and displayed on the surface of the T4 phage. The main advantage of T4 phage is that SOC sites and HOC sites can be displayed simultaneously, and the number of copies displayed is also large.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"> <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">4.

The T7 phage display system can display a 50 amino acid polypeptide in high copy, displaying a polypeptide or protein of 1200 amino acid residues in low copy (0.1-1\/phage) or medium copy (5-15\/phage).

It is also possible to screen antibodies which have weak immunogenic or toxic antigens in vivo and have a wide range of applications.

The cells are used as screening targets, and differentially screened to obtain polypeptides that recognize specific cells. By studying the polypeptide sequence, a receptor protein specifically expressed on the cell surface can be further obtained. The 12-peptide library was screened by HCT116 cells, and a polypeptide which can specifically recognize colon cancer cells was selected from the library. Further analysis revealed that the polypeptide specifically recognizes a-enolase. This protein is expected to be a target for the treatment of colon cancer and to screen for the treatment of colon cancer.
