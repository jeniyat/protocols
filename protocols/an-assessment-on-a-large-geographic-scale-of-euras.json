The data were drawn from a large geographic scale across Eurasia (Austria, China, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia, Serbia, Turkey) and from a large number of saline lakes and pans (N=220) with minimum a 1.0 g L<sup>\u20131<\/sup>\u00a0salinity threshold. The 1.0 g L<sup>\u20131<\/sup>\u00a0salinity threshold was selected based on a former study (Boros et al., 2014), where this threshold was experimentally found to be the characteristic boundary of soda ecosystems. Salinity was estimated by the sum of measured concentrations of eight major ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO<sub>4<\/sub>, HCO<sub>3<\/sub>, CO<sub>3<\/sub>).

Therefore, sites were excluded from the dataset if Na was not the most abundant ion. If seasonal or annual water data were available, mean values were put into database.

However, we cannot estimate a reliable universal accuracy and reproducibility for all data in this study, because none of the published papers reviewed provide data on uncertainty, furthermore, several of them were carried out by different kinds of national standard methods of ion concentration measurements, but all of them are based on the same international methods of ICP-MS for cations (ASTM 3500-Na-C, -K-C, -Ca-C, -Mg-C), alkalinity titration (ASTM 2320 B), chloride argentometric titrimetry (ASTM 4500-Cl<sup>-<\/sup>B) as well as sulfate ions turbidimetry (ASTM 4500-SO<sub>4<\/sub><sup>2-<\/sup>E).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The collected published data were supplemented with some unpublished sample series in the case of Mongolia and Kazakhstan.\u00a0 They are indicated in the attached table as \"Author's unpublished data\". The pH was measured on site using a WTW multiline field instrument with a SenTix 41 electrode.

For the determination of cations (Na<sup>+<\/sup>, K<sup>+<\/sup>, Ca<sup>2+<\/sup>, and Mg<sup>2+<\/sup>), samples were analyzed with the EPA 6020 standard method of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry [40] with 2% accuracy. Anion concentrations were measured according to Hungarian standard analytical methods (MSZ). Chloride ion concentration was determined by the argentometric method (MSZ 448-15:1982). Sulfate ion was precipitated in a strong acidic medium with barium chloride, and the resulting turbidity was measured photometrically at 405 nm and compared with standard solutions (MSZ 12750-16:1998).
