The data were drawn from a large geographic scale across Eurasia (Austria, China, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia, Serbia, Turkey) and from a large number of saline lakes and pans (N=220) with minimum a 1.0 g L<sup>\u20131<\/sup>\u00a0salinity threshold. The 1.0 g L<sup>\u20131<\/sup>\u00a0salinity threshold was selected based on a former study (Boros et al., 2014), where this threshold was experimentally found to be the characteristic boundary of soda ecosystems. Salinity was estimated by the sum of measured concentrations of eight major ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO<sub>4<\/sub>, HCO<sub>3<\/sub>, CO<sub>3<\/sub>). As generally known, sodium is by far the most common cation in saline lakes and necessarily the dominant cation in soda type lakes. Therefore, sites were excluded from the dataset if Na was not the most abundant ion. If seasonal or annual water data were available, mean values were put into database. Most of the data came from papers (sources are indicated in the table).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"11425","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1524838636","protocol_affiliation":"Balaton Limnological Institute, Centre for Ecological Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA),Sobolev Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences","affiliation":"Balaton Limnological Institute, Centre for Ecological Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA)","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.ptidnke","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"EmilBoros-y22334w2u2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","full_name":"Emil Boros","created_by":"Emil Boros","private_link":"67E81464660FF4F67E4056ABA2C5BA80","original_img":"1","username":"emil-boros","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":309172,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"alkaline,bicarbonate,carbonate,chemical types of saline waters,equivalent percentage (e%),pH overlap,rank of dominant ion,Saline type,Soda type,Soda-Saline type,soda brine","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Emil Boros,Marina Kolpakova","authors_list":[{"name":"Emil Boros","affiliation":"Balaton Limnological Institute, Centre for Ecological Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA)","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Marina Kolpakova","affiliation":"Sobolev Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/016.png","username":"emil-boros","full_name":"Emil Boros","created_by":"Emil Boros"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"625777","is_changed":1,"original_id":"620893","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"D808EA5271FF4D33BF3F393E568F981F","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":null,"last_modified":"1524838695","components":[{"component_id":"1101120","previous_id":0,"original_id":"1088650","guid":"18E18C29B01C4D86941313BE7723076D","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1101121","previous_id":"1101120","original_id":"1088651","guid":"1C29EA3B90B14476B9C13B9A73F5CAEE","previous_guid":"18E18C29B01C4D86941313BE7723076D","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1101123","previous_id":"1101121","original_id":"0","guid":"EE007684CC694F968859678E25FBFFAB","previous_guid":"1C29EA3B90B14476B9C13B9A73F5CAEE","component_type_id":"23","data_id":"20874","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"File","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"23","source_data":{"media_url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/wnkjs36.xlsx","original_name":"repository_data_ebmk_final.xlsx","file_id":"20874","thumb_id":null,"thumb_url":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/wnkjs36.xlsx","icon":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/extensions\/xlsx.png"},"is_project":0}],"available_protocols":["11425"]}]}
