CAR in CAR-T is a recombinant receptor, and its structure mainly includes three parts: extracellular antigen binding domain, transmembrane domain and intracellular signal domain.<\/p>\n<p>As an effector cell of the human immune system, T cells are the only cells known to specifically kill tumors. However, before killing tumor cells, T cells must first \"transform\" into activated T cells, and the \"transformation\" process requires activation of both signals:<\/p>\n<p>The first signal activation mode is that T cell receptors (TCRs) bind to major histocompatibility class (MHC) on antigen presenting cells;<\/p>\n<p>The second signal is activated by the co-stimulatory molecule on the antigen-presenting cell. The B7 family molecule binds to the ligand CD28 molecule on the T cell. Under the condition that both signals are activated, T cells can change from resting state to activated T cells, thereby interfering and killing tumor cells by secreting granzyme, perforin, inducing and releasing pro-inflammatory factors.<\/p>\n<p>In tumor patients, a large number of tumor cells can down-regulate MHC expression, which in turn affects T cell activation and causes \"immune escape\". To solve this problem, the scientists invented CAR-T cell immunotherapy, which genetically modified T cells in vitro to make them <em>in vitro<\/em> activated T cells.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAR-T treatment process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In short, it is mainly divided into three steps.

In the third step, the amplified CAR-T cells are returned to the patient, and the CAR-T cells can exert anti-tumor effects in vivo.
