This Fe-based virus flocculation, filtration and resuspension method (FFR) is efficient (&gt; 90% recovery), reliable, inexpensive and adaptable to many aspects of marine viral ecology and genomics research. Recovered viruses are amenable to gene sequencing, and a variable proportion of phages, depending upon the phage, retain their infectivity when recovered if using oxalic acid in the resuspension buffer. Particles lose infectivity if resuspended with ascorbic acid in the buffer.","is_bookmarked":"1","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"1","materials":[{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"2244","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"Millipore Express PLUS filter 0.22 \u00b5m, 142 mm","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"GPWP14250","reagent_url":"http:\/\/www.emdmillipore.com\/US\/en\/product\/Millipore-Express-PLUS-Membrane-Filter%2C-polyethersulfone%2C-Hydrophilic%2C-0.22%C2%A0%C2%B5m%2C-142%C2%A0mm,MM_NF-GPWP14250","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"2245","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":" Pall Supor-800 filter","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"60114","reagent_url":"http:\/\/www.pall.com\/main\/laboratory\/product.page?id=20070","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"},{"product_type_id":"1","reagent_id":"2247","reagent_linfor":"","reagent_mol_weight":"0.00","reagent_name":"GE Polycarbonate Membrane filter ","reagent_public":"1","reagent_sku":"MAINE 1216611","reagent_url":"http:\/\/www.midlandsci.com\/default.aspx?page=item%20detail&itemcode=MAINE+1216611","reagent_vendor_id":"1","reagent_vendor_link":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io","reagent_vendor_logo":"\/img\/vendors\/1.png","reagent_vendor_name":"Contributed by users","can_edit":"0"}],"warning":" Do NOT let the filters dry out before the precipitated viruses are resuspended! This will cause a loss in yield. - It is important that the filters remain moist until resuspension. The excess liquid on top of the filter can provide enough humidity if the tubes are well sealed with a tight-fitting cap and parafilm.  One or two ml of sterile water or 0.2um filtered SW from the same source can be added if necessary to keep the filters moist. - Keep filters at 4\u00b0C until processed, and processing is best if done soon after collection (although we have successfully resuspended particles after several years if stored properly).

The filtrate is filtered again using a Millipore Steripak GP10 or GP20 (cat. SPGPM10RJ or SPGPM20RJ; 0.22&mu;m). The GP 10 works for &lt;10L volumes and GP20 works for &lt;20L volumes. Larger capsule filters will easily filter 100-200 liters: Pall Acropak 200, 500, 1000 and 1500. The cellular fraction is retained on the filter while the virus fraction is in the filtrate. <br \/><br \/>Filtration should be done at a maximum pressure of 15 psi. A peristaltic pump applies the pressure and a stainless steel Millipore filter rig (PN YY3014236) holds filters. For less expense, use an acrylic or polycarbonate 142 mm filter holder (Geotech Environmental Equipment, acrylic or PC) and pressurize carboy with an air pump. Most lab vacuum pumps have an air-pressure outlet on the other side that can easily be adjusted to provide 15 psi pressure. Nalgene sells caps for their 20L carboys with fittings in the top that can be used for pressurization. <br \/><br \/><strong>FeCl<sub>3<\/sub> Formulation<\/strong>: The solution of ferric chloride hexahydrate is calculated based on the amount of iron, not on the amount of the salt. The stock solution has 10g Fe per liter. For precipitation, the final optimal concentration of Fe in seawater (SW) is 1mg Fe per liter SW which is equal to 2.9mg FeCl<sub>3<\/sub> per liter SW or to 4.83mg FeCl<sub>3<\/sub>&middot;6H<sub>2<\/sub>O per liter SW.<br \/> <br \/><strong>Equipment Care<\/strong>: Carboys and collection bottles should be washed with 1N HCl and rinsed with MilliQ water before use. Checking tubing before use and replace if worn. Always rinse stainless steel filter rigs with MilliQ water after use and air dry to prevent corrosion.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><strong>Original Author(s)<\/strong>: Seth John, Bonnie Poulos<br \/> <strong>Revision Author(s)<\/strong>: Bonnie Poulos, Christine Schirmer&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><strong>Citation<\/strong>: John, S.G., Mendez, C.B., Deng, L., Poulos, B., Kauffman, A.K.M., Kern, S., Brum, J., Polz, M.F., Boyle, E.A., &amp; Sullivan, M.B.

Oxalic acid dihydrate (FW=126.07), use 2.52g\/100ml for 0.2M.&nbsp; See below for testing, but for oxalic acid buffer to stay in solution, use half the amount of MgCl<sub>2<\/sub>-6H<sub>2<\/sub>O (i.e., 2.035g\/100ml).<br \/>**Tested recipe using 0.2M MgSO4&middot;7H2O (4.93g\/100ml) but still turned cloudy then white after final pH.&nbsp;<strong><br \/><br \/>2X Ascorbic Acid Buffer: <\/strong>Keep the amount of Tris-base, water and NaOH the same, but increase the amount of EDTA, Mg and ascorbate 2x. Check the pH and add NaOH or HCl to get final pH to 6.5. If increasing 2x, you can use 1 ml for every 2 mg Fe(=1 ml for every 2L seawater precipitated).<strong> <br \/><br \/>Notes:<\/strong> <br \/>The original formulation for EDTA-Mg buffer used the chemical Mg-EDTA which is no longer available. The new formulation is now a sodium (Na) salt, and it only contains one Mg ion. For this reason, preparation of the resuspension buffer for iron chloride precipitates should be made from EDTA, disodium salt, and MgCl2. The two most common forms of these chemicals is EDTA-Na2-2H2O (dihydrate) and MgCl26H2O (hexahydrate). <br \/><br \/>When preparing this buffer, keep in mind that EDTA needs a pH above 8.0 to dissolve, and will come out of solution when the pH drops below about 5.0. Ascorbic acid also seems to come out of solution if the pH is very high. The amount of reductant (ascorbic acid or oxalic acid) can vary between 0.125M and 0.25M; this formulation uses 0.2M. Since EDTA is dissolved first, this formulation prepares 0.125M Tris using Tris-base, which allows the EDTA to go into solution more quickly.<br \/><br \/>Recipe tested with diluted amounts of key reagents:<br \/><br \/>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Reagent w\/normal amount per<\/strong><br \/><strong>100ml<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&frac12; Na<sub>2<\/sub>-EDTA<\/strong><br \/><strong>(1.86g\/100ml)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&frac12; MgCl<sub>2<\/sub><\/strong><br \/><strong>(2.04g\/100ml)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&frac12; Oxalic Acid&middot;2H<sub>2<\/sub>O<\/strong><br \/><strong>(1.46g\/100ml)<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tris-base 1.51g\/100ml<\/td>\n<td>clear; pH 10.79<\/td>\n<td>clear; pH 10.82<\/td>\n<td>clear; pH 10.78<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Na<sub>2<\/sub>-EDTA 3.72g\/100ml<\/td>\n<td>clear<\/td>\n<td>clear<\/td>\n<td>clear<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MgCl<sub>2<\/sub>&middot;6H<sub>2<\/sub>O 4.07g\/100ml<\/td>\n<td>clear; pH 7.68<\/td>\n<td>clear; pH 4.89<\/td>\n<td>clear; pH 4.59<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5N NaOH<\/td>\n<td>none; pH 7.68<\/td>\n<td>1.25ml; pH 7.23<\/td>\n<td>1.5ml; pH 7.51<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oxalic acid&middot;2H<sub>2<\/sub>O 2.52g\/100ml<\/td>\n<td>white; pH 1.68<\/td>\n<td>cloudy; pH 3.02<\/td>\n<td>white; pH 3.30<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5N NaOH<\/td>\n<td>6.75ml; cleared ~pH<br \/>4.5; but turned white<br \/>at pH 6.5; total 5N<br \/>NaOH=6.75ml<\/td>\n<td>6.25ml; cleared ~pH<br \/>4.5; but turned a little<br \/>cloudy at pH 6.5; total<br \/>5N NaOH=7.5ml<\/td>\n<td>3.75ml; never cleared;<br \/>became cloudy then<br \/>white at pH 6.5; total<br \/>5N NaOH=5.25ml<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>QS to 100ml with H<sub>2<\/sub>O<\/td>\n<td>pH 6.59; white<\/td>\n<td>pH 6.58; cloudy<\/td>\n<td>pH 6.61; white<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Final results<\/td>\n<td>worst of all after 2hr<\/td>\n<td>looks best after 2hr<\/td>\n<td>intermediate after 2hr<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<br \/>Photo of solutions after final pH:<br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/dxc2xe.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>Note the &frac12; MgCl<sub>2<\/sub> beaker on the left is the most clear but still a little cloudy.
