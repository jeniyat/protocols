For any experiment, testing should take place during the same 2-3 hour period on each day. Morning or afternoon testing at least one hour prior to dark cycle onset are appropriate. Testing after \u201clights out\u201d in the vivarium is not appropriate. If a study requires multiple cohorts for testing, each 9-day trial will begin on the same day of the week. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Mixed sex test groups: Males and females should be tested in different test groups (of 8 or 16), preferably in different cohorts and after a water change. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Test order: Test order strongly affects performance. The experimental groups (as designated in the design) should be randomized in the test order. A confounded experiment results if all animals in one group are tested before all the animals in another group. If multiple cohorts are used, the randomization should extend across all cohorts. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Trial Timing: Mice undergo 4 consecutive training trials (i.e. mice remain the maze, either swimming or on the platform). The fifth trial (retention trial) is completed 30-40 minutes following the end of the fourth training trial. The data recorder will keep track of the time the 4th trial ended and when 30 minutes have passed (i.e. with a timer). The training trials for subsequent mice will continue during this 30-40 minute retention period. After 30 minutes, the fifth trial will be conducted on a previous mouse following the completion of any current training trials on a new mouse. All 4 training trials for a new mouse must be completed prior to starting a fifth trial on previous mouse (i.e. there is no pausing between the 4 training trials). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Blinding: To assure lack of bias, the experimental groups of the animals should not be displayed on the animal housing, the lab schedule, or the data sheets. Experimental group can be added to the datasets after completion of the study.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Group housing: Social interaction can affect performance. The caging used for the study should be standardized and reported with the data. If more than one animal per cage, the cage of each animal should be designated in the data set so cagemates can be identified. If caging changes (animals separated or dying) this should be reported with the data also. In order to randomize test order when 4-5 mice in the same experimental group are housed together, the mice need to be separated into individual cages prior to starting each day of testing. After the testing has completed for the day, mice will be recombined in their original home cage with the same cagemates. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Water maze maintenance: Prior to the testing on each day, stir the water in the maze to ensure even opacity of the paint. The maze is to be cleaned on day 5. This includes: draining and rinsing the maze and tub with clean water, disinfecting all surfaces with 10% nolvasan solution and re-rinsing with fresh water. After cleaning, the maze will be refilled with fresh water and paint to the correct opacity. On day 9, repeat the cleaning process but do not refill with fresh water\/paint if no further testing will be conducted on study. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Test group size: Because of the 30-40minute intertribal interval, animals should be tested in groups of 8 or 16. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Protocol deviations: A log of protocol deviations should accompany the data sets to help evaluate \u201coutliers\u201d in the dataset. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":null,"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"duration":0},{"id":717763,"guid":"7F9C1600403911E9918DDDC9223B77A0","previous_id":717637,"previous_guid":"CA3D65A0403011E9A6314DAFBCB81A2F","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"C5B1CFF103E849E8BB89A8F14E7C279B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D825D799BADF4CEBB276F13A00C28726","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Protocol: <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">RAWM Apparatus and Set Up: <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">RAWM Apparatus: Six arm apparatus (30.5 \u201cdiameter, 8\u201d high, 10\u201d long, 5 5\/8\u201d wide) in swim pool.
