This procedure is to be followed by administrative personnel responsible for accepting commercial or courier-delivered shipments of mice and by Vivarium personnel responsible for unpacking and caging mice.  Transportation of mice is stressful and potentially dangerous to their health, especially in warm summer months.  Mice need to be unpacked, have a health inspection, and housed in appropriate caging in appropriate numbers as soon as possible after arrival.  This insures they are acclimated and in the best physical health prior to their use by the Mouse Biology Program.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557330721}
