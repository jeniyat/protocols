The concept of resilience can be thought of as a stress coping ability with\u00a0 positive adaptation and outcomes in the face of adversities (Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003) and should act as a buffer against the harmful effects of future stressors. In support of this notion Sherrin and colleagues (Sheerin et al., 2017) in a\u00a0 longitudinal study reported that higher resilience was a protective factor against future internalising psychopathology. Moreover, using the dot-probe task to assess individual differences in attentional bias towards happy or angry facial expressions Thoern et al., (Thoern, Grueschow, Ehlert, Ruff, &amp; Kleim, 2016) observed that healthy participants with a greater attentional bias towards happy faces reported higher trait resilience. This finding may have implications for a number of stress-related disorders and suggests that increasing the tendency to attend to emotionally positive stimuli could render individuals more resilient. However, Thoern and colleagues did not take into account individual differences in neuroticism, circadian preference or depressive symptomatology (three recognised risk factors for depression). The aims of the current proposal, therefore, are to: 1) replicate the findings of Thoern and colleagues, i.e. that increased attention to positive emotional stimuli predicts trait resilience, 2) extend this work to include emotion recognition, and 3) explore the interaction between risk factors for depression, resilience and attentional bias\/emotion recognition <\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"11659","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1524222819","protocol_affiliation":"University of Roehampton","affiliation":"University of Roehampton","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.pmjdk4n","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"raynorbury-y22374z2x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/v9ujwge.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","full_name":"ray norbury","created_by":"ray norbury","private_link":"3047DCD150524CC33AE9013F0FFF1402","original_img":"1","username":"ray-norbury","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":308317,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Emotion","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":1,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"ray norbury","authors_list":[{"name":"ray norbury","affiliation":"University of Roehampton","username":"ray-norbury","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png"}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/015.png","username":"ray-norbury","full_name":"ray norbury","created_by":"ray norbury"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"1","can_add":"1","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"1","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"2","is_research":"1","status_info":"We are still developing and optimizing this protocol","steps":[{"id":"623322","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"C1CE3C6D230848DEA6A81DB0ACB7639A","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1524223269","components":[{"component_id":"1094935","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"0F23F4CB549B477D9BF955985D973B7E","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"Invite your participant to complete the consent form and be ready to respond to any questions.","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"Invite your participant to complete the consent form and be ready to respond to any questions."},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1094936","previous_id":"1094935","original_id":"0","guid":"F5CE17A64E264AD1BDC191357E9A3241","previous_guid":"0F23F4CB549B477D9BF955985D973B7E","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"623323","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"7CC331B4E03B4003BE3018053D64E62D","previous_guid":"A5BD15576E424E5DAB811582B590F970","previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1524223269","components":[{"component_id":"1094927","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"87330918ED0849E8B943B64D8C6DD914","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"At this point you should read the following instructions to your participant (the order of these will depend on the participant number) :Dot Probe\u201cWe are now going to show you two faces on the screen at a time.
