This reduces their chance of getting dehydrated hence increasing their ability to survive. When planting, place the older ends of the cuttings into the soil first, as this ensures that auxiliary buds face upwards and not downwards (Fig 2). Auxiliary buds, which develop into shoots, should be above the nodes and not below the nodes to enable them to grow upwards. After the planting has been completed, water the plants and keep them well-watered by watering them at least twice a day or as weather conditions demand.

You can use a sharp razor blade for this purpose, if you do not have fancy cutting tools. Do not forget to disinfect your cutting tools. Re-cutting the shoot ends ensures that any bruised ends that can encourage rotting are removed. Slanted cut ends give the root ends a greater surface area for water absorption. Cut off the stem at a distance of 0.5 cm away from the initial shoot end before you make the slanted cut, if necessary you can go up to 1 cm. The slanted cut should be a 0.5 cm long diagonal cut. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Shoots must not have too many leaves on them when being rooted. Thus, constantly remove any excess leaves from each cassava shoot, leaving behind only 2 - 3 leaves. Leaves should be carefully removed by plucking off only the leaf blades. Petioles should be left to fall off on their own, with time. In other words, do not remove leaves from shoots by plucking off the petioles together with the leaf blade as this may wound the shoots.

Any container can be used. A cut out base of a 10 L water container was used in Fig 5. Enough height (10 - 12 cm) should be left on the container walls as walls give support to shoots and they off course enable the container to hold enough water. The container should however be opaque to block out the sunlight as this discourages algae growth on the walls and floors of the container. In Fig 6 you can see that this was achieved by having the sides of the transparent containers covered with opaque plastic bags. Prepare a number of these containers so that you will not have to squeeze too many plants into one container. Too many plants in one container makes the rooting water to quickly get bad which in turn enhances shoot rot. Fig 5 shows that right amount of shoot crowding in a container.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Note:<\/span><span> Some researchers may advise to root shoots in individual small containers, probably to avoid disease transmission between shoots.

Do not add too much water into the containers as the shoot ends may float. Test to check which water level is best. Adding only a little water is also undesirable.

Shoots should be continually checked for any signs of rotting, which often begins at the shoot ends. Always check the odour and temperature of the water in each container, as this can give an indication of something going wrong. Bad water odours and overly warm water temperatures can be a sign of the setting in of anoxic conditions. Temperature changes are best observed when it is cool as this avoids confusion with changes resulting from warm ambient temperatures. Check on the shoots at least twice a day.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Water in rooting containers should be often replaced. Water replacement should ideally be carried out every after 2 days, but sometimes, especially towards the end this can be even done after 3 days. The water in the rooting containers should however be changed each day, to allow shoots to adjust to their new environment during the first week after planting. The frequency of changing water will however be higher when plants are crowded in containers. Remember to always wash the containers before pouring in fresh water.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">During root development shoots will continue to grow new leaves even before they begin to root. The rate of new leaf development will vary between varieties just as the rate of root development. Some cassava varieties will also keep elongating their stems as they develop new leaves. Older leaves should constantly be trimmed off to leave behind only 2 to 3 leaves on each shoot. If excess leaves are not removed from shoots, water loss from containers is increased, due to higher evapotranspiration rates. More importantly root development is also delayed as the few available nutrient reserves in the small shoots get expended on shoot growth rather than on root growth. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Fig 7 shows an example of cassava shoots that have just began rooting, while Fig 8 shows cassava shoots with progressed rooting.

Transplanting should only be carried out after the soils in the pots have been watered to field capacity and left in this state overnight.  On the following day and in the early morning hours you can then begin transplanting. Make a 5 cm deep hole in the moist soil and gently place in the now rooted cassava plantlets (Fig 9). The plantlets will be happier and full of life once in the soil (Fig 10).

Rooted plantlets are however best for pot experiments, due to the short timeframes of these experiments. Unless large pots (more than 5 L capacity) are used, cassava grown in pots is not usually grown for more than 3 \u2013 4 months. Clear responses to nutrient supply in cassava plants cannot be obtained within such short timeframes with mature cassava stem cuttings because of the large amount of nutrient reserves contained in mature cassava stem cuttings. The nutrient reserves delay the observation of responses to soil nutrient supply (fertiliser application). Responses to other treatments are also probably delayed when mature stem cuttings are planted in pot experiments instead of young succulent, nutrient hungry rooted plantlets. This protocol describes how to produce rooted cassava plantlets or shoots for use in pot experiments. The protocol would not have been developed without guidance from Dr R.H. Howeler. The protocol is also based on a protocol he had already prepared in the Cassava Handbook (see bibliography for citation).
