Mean age of diagnosis was 49.2 years and 56.19% were male. 62.40% of patients were married and 87.05% were white. Most patients (90.42%) were diagnosed with AO as their first malignant primary tumor. 87.89% of patients had received cancer-directed surgery. Patients receiving surgery had a better prognosis for overall survival (OS) compared to those not receiving surgery after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis (p<0.05). The overall 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year survival of AO was 78.7%\uff0c60%\uff0c50.2% and 36.2% respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that age, marital status, first malignant primary indicator and surgery were associated with OS whereas sex and race were not. Moreover, an age value of 52 years was calculated as an optimal cutoff value to distinguish better and worse OS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated that older age (OR 1.040, 95%CL 1.035-1.045), single patients (OR 1.293, 95%CL 1.103-1.515) and AO being not first malignant primary tumor (OR 1.501, 95%CL 1.238-1.820) were significantly associated with worse OS whereas surgery (OR 0.584, 95%CL 0.494-0.689) was associated with better OS. Moreover, a nomogram predicting 5- and 10-year survival probability for AO was constructed based on these variables.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Conclusion<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Age, marital status, first malignant primary indicator and surgery were associated with survival of AO. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1545638389}
