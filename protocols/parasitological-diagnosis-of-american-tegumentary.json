Moreover, it is also used as the culture of cells from other dipteran species.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">SCHNEIDER\u2032S INSECT MEDIUM is one of the cell culture media available from Sigma.

A cursory survey of the formulas of culture media designed for insect tissues reveals great qualitative and quantitative disparities in composition. Different media designed for the same species may exhibit less similarity than do two media designed for insects of different orders. Various media have been devised for in vitro culture of Drosophila cells and tissues. The most extensively used are Schneider\u2032s medium and Echalier and Ohanessian\u2032s D-22 medium. Drosophila cells have been employed to study a variety of biological processes including genetics, endocrinology, physiology and cell biology as well as recombinant protein expression.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Preparation Note - Schneider\u00b4s Insect Medium \u2013 S9895- SIGMA - Concentration: 24.5 g\/L<\/span><span>\n Powdered media are extremely hygroscopic and should be protected from atmospheric moisture.

In addition, the isolation of the agent allows the sample to be maintained, cryopreserved and subsequently characterized by biochemical or molecular techniques. One of the disadvantages of this method is the possibility of external contaminants (bacteria and fungi) from the lesion or the environment.
