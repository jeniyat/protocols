However, herbal materials derived from <em>Aristolochia<\/em> species have been identified as potent human carcinogens since the first case of severe renal disease after ingesting these herbal preparations. Any products containing <em>Aristolochia<\/em> species have thus been banned on many continents, including Europe, America and Asia. Therefore, the development of a method to identify these herbs is critically needed for customer safety. The present study evaluated DNA barcoding of the <em>rbc<\/em>L, <em>mat<\/em>K, ITS2 and <em>trn<\/em>H-<em>psb<\/em>A regions among eleven <em>Aristolochia<\/em> species collected in Thailand. Polymorphic sites were observed in all four DNA loci. Among those eleven <em>Aristolochia<\/em> species, three species (<em>A. pierrei<\/em>, <em>A. tagala<\/em> and <em>A. pothieri<\/em>) are used as herbal materials in Thai folk medicine, namely, in Thai \u201cKrai-Krue\u201d. \u201cKrai-Krue\u201d herbs are interchangeably used as an admixture in Thai traditional remedies without specific knowledge of their identities. A species-specific multiplex PCR based on nucleotide polymorphisms in the ITS2 region was developed as an identification tool to differentiate these three <em>Aristolochia<\/em> species and to supplement the HPTLC pattern in clarifying the origins of herbal materials. The combination of multiplex PCR and HPTLC profiling achieves accurate herbal identification with the goal of protecting consumers from the health risks associated with product substitution and contamination.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"13915","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1532065709","protocol_affiliation":"DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants Research Unit, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand,Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.rt3d6qn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"w2t234w2y2x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","full_name":"PIROONRAT DECHBUMROONG","created_by":"PIROONRAT DECHBUMROONG","private_link":"92D8BB28EE04BACEE706FC52C8AAABDF","original_img":"1","username":"piroonrat-dechbumroong","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":332532,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Aristolochia, DNA barcode,","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Piroonrat Dechbumroong,Surattana Aumnouypol,Jessada Denduangboripant,Suchada Sukrong","authors_list":[{"name":"Piroonrat Dechbumroong","affiliation":"DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants Research Unit, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Surattana Aumnouypol","affiliation":"DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants Research Unit, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Jessada Denduangboripant","affiliation":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Suchada Sukrong","affiliation":"DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants Research Unit, Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University Drug and Health Products Innovation Promotion Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","username":"piroonrat-dechbumroong","full_name":"PIROONRAT DECHBUMROONG","created_by":"PIROONRAT DECHBUMROONG"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"646027","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"771FFB4EED94496D864A416F3CEA6313","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1532066040","components":[{"component_id":"1152712","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"FA6AE56F41B745FA869435767A3C0FC7","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Plant materials","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Plant materials"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1152711","previous_id":"1152712","original_id":"0","guid":"0B3C7139279E4C5F89AE54BB9A922B2F","previous_guid":"FA6AE56F41B745FA869435767A3C0FC7","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Thirty-eight specimens of eleven <em>Aristolochia<\/em> taxa were collected from various regions of Thailand.\u00a0All specimens were identified by Associate Professor Thatree Phadungcharoen at the Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.
