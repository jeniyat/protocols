The developed model can work at different stages of complexity. That is, depending on different analysis purposes and necessities, the parametric scaling can be detailed with several accurate anthropometric measurements, and the dimensions of each skeleton\u2019s component are estimated and fitted to match the subject\u2019s skeleton. To this aim, various protocols involving different body labelling (and so different related anthropometric data) have been established for separate analyses.<\/p>\n<p>A<span style=\"background-color: #f5f6f5;\">\u00a027 markers protocol has been set t<\/span>o analyse human posture and spinal associated pathologies (scoliosis, back pain etc.),\u00a0 and tested extensively in the clinical environment.
