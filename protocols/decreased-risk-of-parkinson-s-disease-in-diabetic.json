Rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability are the four classical motor symptoms. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The annual incidence is 14\/100 000 of the total population in Europe and the Americas, while the rate increased to 160\/100 000 in people aged over 65 years.
