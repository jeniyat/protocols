(2003), and the following method is appropriate for both natural and cultured phytoplankton&ndash;virus systems (Fig. 1). The approach is based around combining mesoplankton-free seawater (whole water) with either grazer-free or virus-free diluents. To prevent contamination of seawater samples by handling, vinyl gloves are worn throughout the water collection and experimental setup. To create mesoplankton-free whole water for experiments, seawater is gently siphoned through 200-&micro;m mesh (or reverse sieved, Baudoux et al. 2006) using silicone tubing into clean, polypropylene carboys. Additional (reverse) prefiltration may be required, e.g., during sampling of colonial phytoplankton (Baudoux et al. 2006) or in productive, coastal, or sediment-filled waters, to prevent clogging during the later fine-scale filtration. Gentle filtration and avoidance of air bubbling are crucial to prevent destruction of the grazer, virus, and phytoplankton populations. To protect the phytoplankton communities within the seawater sample from excessive light (light-shock), experiments using natural phytoplankton populations are best set up predawn in dimmed-light conditions using light-proofed carboys. It is also recommended that experiments be performed at the same time of day because of the synchronicity of phytoplankton cell division and potential diel effects on viral infection processes. Filtration and handling should be conducted at in situ temperature. Handling time once the seawater has been collected should be kept to a minimum before the start of the experimental incubation. Ideally experimental setup should be within an hour of water collection if possible.<br \/><br \/><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/2ic2w6.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/2hc2w6.jpg\" data-ofn=\"Figure 1.jpg\" \/><br \/><br \/><strong>Figure 1<\/strong>:&nbsp;Modified dilution assay experimental design.
