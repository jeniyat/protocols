Running activity is evaluated from the number of rotations of a stationary wheel detected by sensors attached to running wheel. Running wheel activity provides information regarding when the animal runs, for how long and far, providing temporal and longitudinal data. This system may also be used as a means of providing voluntary exercise in metabolic or exercise based studies. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1557940101}
