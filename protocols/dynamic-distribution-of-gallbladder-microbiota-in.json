All PCR procedures were performed using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with the PCR programs. The PCR was run in a total reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL. Each reaction mixture contained 2.5-\u03bcL 10\u00d7PCR buffer, 2-\u03bcL dNTP, 2-\u03bcL forward and reverse primers (1 \u03bcL each), 0.5-\u03bcL Taq DNA polymerase, 2-\u03bcL DNA template, and 11-\u03bcL sterile water. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C denaturation for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C of annealing for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C of extension for 30 seconds, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes [26]. A mixture of PCR products was purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Then the PCR products were used to generate a sequencing library with the TruSeq DNA PCRFREE Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, San Diego, CA, USA).

Raw data obtained by sequencing contained a certain proportion of disturbance data (dirty data). In order to make the results of information analysis more accurate and reliable, the raw data were first spliced and filtered to obtain valid data (clean data). Then the clean data were subjected to chimera filtration to obtain effective data for subsequent analysis. We clustered effective tags for all samples and clustered sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a 97% sequence identity. A representative sequence for each OTU was selected and classified using the Greengene database gg_13_8. According to the analysis of OTUs, the species with the highest abundance at each taxonomic level (phylum, class, order, family, and genus) for each sample was selected to generate the relative abundance of species. The bacterial abundance and diversity of the samples were determined by calculating the Shannon-Weaver diversity index, ACE, and Chao 1 after taking into account the number and uniformity of the bacterial species. Sequence alignment and construction of the phylogenetic tree was performed using the PyNAST method. Then the phylogenetic tree was used for Unweighted UniFrac Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). This study used PCoA to analyze the similarity of the composition of gallbladder flora in pre-weaning young rabbits and adult rabbits. According to results of the OTU clustering analysis and research needs, the common and unique OTUs among different samples (groups) were analyzed. When the number of samples (groups) was less than 5, the Venn Graph was drawn.
