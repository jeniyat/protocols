Others will disagree.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>What you won't get is the Ubuntu graphical user interface. You are still stuck with running Windows 10. If that is a problem for you, then dual booting or a virtual machine is probably your best option. Instead, what Ubuntu on Windows offers is a simple way to get access to the command line from Ubuntu. Not only does that mean that you can run software designed and compiled to run on Linux, but you can also use all the cool tools of Ubuntu like apt-get to seamlessly install programs, keep them up-to-date, and fetch\u00a0dependences.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>An alternative guide to Linux on Windows using Conda:<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/kapsakcj\/win10-linux-conda-how-to\/blob\/master\/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/github.com\/kapsakcj\/win10-linux-conda-how-to\/blob\/master\/README.md<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<footer>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<\/footer>","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"652924","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"A62BF73ED4894DE5BBEFA33D6EC6F880","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1533875710","components":[{"component_id":"1170608","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"147148C8639245E2BC57C9524DCF3C18","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Installing Ubuntu","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Installing Ubuntu"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1170607","previous_id":"1170608","original_id":"0","guid":"E842946942124E4592586B8BFDC42871","previous_guid":"147148C8639245E2BC57C9524DCF3C18","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Ensure your Windows10 has the 2018 Fall Creators update (version 1709 or greater).\u00a0<\/p>","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Ensure your Windows10 has the 2018 Fall Creators update (version 1709 or greater).\u00a0<\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"652928","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"E9683AC3EA7746E7941065257A0A5CD9","previous_guid":"A62BF73ED4894DE5BBEFA33D6EC6F880","previous_id":"652924","last_modified":"1533875959","components":[{"component_id":"1170616","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"D2D9E5B559F349F08768E92F5E9A3919","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Installing Ubuntu","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Installing Ubuntu"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1170615","previous_id":"1170616","original_id":"0","guid":"8EF3D8FAFD784675B9C173EA60819954","previous_guid":"D2D9E5B559F349F08768E92F5E9A3919","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Go to the Windows App store and download Ubuntu app:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/49efw26.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/49dfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"01_App_store.png\" \/><\/p>","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Go to the Windows App store and download Ubuntu app:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/49efw26.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/49dfw26.png\" data-ofn=\"01_App_store.png\" \/><\/p>"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"652929","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"871A1839813E41BE9C4E503406896394","previous_guid":"E9683AC3EA7746E7941065257A0A5CD9","previous_id":"652928","last_modified":"1533940624","components":[{"component_id":"1170618","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"743B1010E5EC4815ABB8A70C3CA4EDCF","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Installing Ubuntu","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Installing Ubuntu"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1170617","previous_id":"1170618","original_id":"0","guid":"42E4147A246B4650A8C981AFC0094CD1","previous_guid":"743B1010E5EC4815ABB8A70C3CA4EDCF","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Once the app is installed, open it up.
