A few questions came up ...\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>1) Should the EDTA and EGTA both be at 100mM final concentration or is this a combined molarity of both?\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>2) Why are EDTA and EGTA also added to the resuspended pellet? (is DNase still potentially present)\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>3) Your protocol says to use a SW32.1Ti rotor and just prior says to use no more than 25-\u00ad30ml of sample with 10ml sucrose but the tubes for this rotor only holds 17ml (whereas the SW32Ti rotor uses 38ml tubes).\u00a0 Can you clarify the amounts and rotor?\u00a0 (just want to confirm g force for the centrifugation since 32K rpm in 32.1Ti = 187,000g \u00a0whereas 32K RPM in 32Ti = 175,000g)<br \/><br \/>\u00a0From: \"Williamson, Shannon\"\u00a0 <br \/>Date: October 21, 2009 9:33:34 AM GMT-\u00ad-07:00<br \/>To: \"Matthew Sullivan\"<br \/>Subject: RE: few quick Qs\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Hi Matt,\u00a0Here are some answers for you...\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>1) 100mM is the final concentration of each. So 100mM EGTA and 100mM EDTA.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>2) The EDTA\/EGTA is added here just as a precaution to remove Mg and Ca in the case that we have any enzymes after we do the DNA extraction. The possibility of having bacterial cells here is very slim but we do not take chances especially with viral DNA yields being what they are. Also, it is possible to do the DNAse reaction after the sucrose cushion, which is recommended if you want to work in smaller volumes and save money and reagents.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>3) For the sucrose cushion you want to make sure you have about 1\/8-1\/6 of the total ultra centrifuge tube volume to be your sucrose cushion with the remainder being your concentrated VC. As long as you can get up to 30,000g or 32,000g it doesn't matter which rotor or tubes you use. It really comes down to how comfortable you are concentrating your VC to small enough volumes to fit the tubes.\u00a0 We have done the sucrose cushion in the 5ml, 15ml, and 38ml ultra tubes, and all have worked well.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br \/><br \/>Please let me know if you have any additional questions.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Best wishes,<br \/>Shannon\u00a0<br \/><br \/>From: Matthew Sullivan<br \/>Sent: Thursday, October 22, 2009 9:31 AM<br \/>To: Williamson, Shannon<br \/>Subject: Re: few quick Qs\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Hey Shannon,<br \/><br \/>Thanks so much for the response ... do you mean 30,000 g or RPM below?\u00a0\u00a0 (my first time doing a sucrose gradient and I'm told these things are\u00a0\u00a0 very spin sensitive)<br \/><br \/>All the best,<br \/>Matt\u00a0<br \/><br \/>From: \"Williamson, Shannon\"<br \/>Date: October 22, 2009 1:35:45 PM GMT\u00c2\u00c2\u009007:00<br \/>To: \"Matthew Sullivan\"\u00a0 <br \/>Subject: RE: few quick Qs\u00a0<br \/><br \/>It's RPM, sorry about that!<br \/><br \/>From: Matthew Sullivan\u00a0 <br \/>To: Bonnie Poulos\u00a0 <br \/>Subject: Fwd: few quick Qs<br \/>Date: Thu, 22 Oct 2009 13:37:54 \u00c2\u00c2\u00900700\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Hey Bonnie it's RPM ...","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"126783","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"EFDF3E4C6CFA4B309CA2B38E5965148B","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1502718568","components":[{"component_id":"973057","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"7E6B5D557D0140F7AE8E707683678766","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":null,"order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":null},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"116809","previous_id":"973057","original_id":"0","guid":"7C501612827448BAA48D8B0E313928C1","previous_guid":"7E6B5D557D0140F7AE8E707683678766","component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"Prepare sucrose (Molecular Biology Grade or higher) as 38% (weight to volume) in SM buffer (100mM NaCl, 8mM MgSO4, 50mM TrisJHCl, pH 7.5) that has been 0.2&mu;m filtered.","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"Prepare sucrose (Molecular Biology Grade or higher) as 38% (weight to volume) in SM buffer (100mM NaCl, 8mM MgSO4, 50mM TrisJHCl, pH 7.5) that has been 0.2&mu;m filtered."},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"126784","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"37BC26543DA847ADA41E2BB5B3706660","previous_guid":"EFDF3E4C6CFA4B309CA2B38E5965148B","previous_id":"126783","last_modified":"1502718568","components":[{"component_id":"973058","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"2311CBFDCAAE4410A3B46281D578FD33","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":null,"order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":null},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"116810","previous_id":"973058","original_id":"0","guid":"739320CB2A5F429BAE60404757D836E9","previous_guid":"2311CBFDCAAE4410A3B46281D578FD33","component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"Rinse SW40 tubes with SM buffer or sterile water.&nbsp;","order_id":"1","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"Rinse SW40 tubes with SM buffer or sterile water.&nbsp;"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"116811","previous_id":"116810","original_id":"0","guid":"B0E3FDC44C6E4AA7A34A3411B8788F6F","previous_guid":"739320CB2A5F429BAE60404757D836E9","component_type_id":"26","data_id":"7802","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Note","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"26","source_data":{"annotation_id":"7802","thread_id":"7802","id":"7802","thread_title":"Annotation on step 2 of Purifying Viruses Using Sucrose Cushion","uri":"annotation-on-step-2-of-purifying-viruses-using-sucrose","thread_uri":"annotation-on-step-2-of-purifying-viruses-using-sucrose","step_id":"126784","protocol_uri":"Purifying-Viruses-Using-Sucrose-Cushion-c3wypd","protocol_name":"Purifying Viruses Using Sucrose Cushion","protocol_name_html":"Purifying Viruses Using Sucrose Cushion","annotation":"The SW 40 tubes hold 12 ml total volume.&nbsp;The protocol calls for using 2.5ml 38% sucrose as the cushion, which leaves 9.5 ml volume for the sample.&nbsp;If the DNase treated sample (reaction stopped with EDTA\/EGTA) is less than this, add SM buffer to bring the sample up to 9.5 ml.
