It illustrates how incorporation of these noncanonical amino acids into new proteins can be detected in whole cells via copper-catalyzed or strain-promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry and outlines how the visualization of translational activity can be combined with the taxonomic identification of cells via FISH.

The protocol can be preformed within 1\u20132 hours to identify transcriptionally active microorganisms in a variety of environmental samples after incubation with a methionine surrogate. \u00a0In our experience, the BONCAT reaction is\u00a0generally not influenced by the presence of complex organic (e.g., an extracellular matrix) or inorganic (e.g., minerals or sediment particles) substances. This results in a low level of background noise when applied to environmental samples. While copper-catalyzed click chemistry can be employed to detect both AHA- and HPG-tagged proteins, the strain-promoted click reaction is restricted to the visualization of AHA uptake (because HPG does not contain an azide group).<br \/><br \/>Solutions required for BONCAT labeling (Unless indicated otherwise, all reagents can be stored at room temperature).<\/p>\n<p><br \/>For L-2-amino-4-azidobutanoic acid (L-azidohomoalanine, AHA): Dissolve in nano-pure water, adjust to pH 7.0, filter sterilize (0.2 \u03bcm), and store in the dark at 4\u00baC.
