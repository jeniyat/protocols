for KingFisher)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Knight lab has transitioned to the QIAGEN\u00ae MagAttract\u00ae PowerSoil\u00ae DNA KF Kit (384) (Optimized for KingFisher). We have validated a variety of sample types to ensure reproducibility when compared to MoBio PowerSoil Extraction Kit. This transition occurred to increase efficiency and reduce DNA extraction time from 6-8 hours to 3-4 hours.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The protocol is followed as\u00a0QIAGEN\u00ae recommends, with an added 10-minute water bath incubation at 65\u00b0C after the Lysis buffer addition, and retention of\u00a0the 10-minute incubation at 4\u00b0C after lysate addition to IR Solution.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The new kit can be implemented on the epMotion using a magnetic bead plate adapter for the epMotion. However, it does not reduce the amount of time the extraction takes by a significant amount: tests showed that the new kit on the epMotion took longer than the old kit. Comparison showed both the old and new kit performed well on the epMotion.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mobio.com\/products\/dna-isolation\/soil\/powersoilr-htp-96-well-soil-dna-isolation-kit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>QIAGEN\u00ae MagAttract\u00ae PowerSoil\u00ae DNA KF Kit (384)<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The QIAGEN\u00ae DNeasy\u00ae PowerSoil\u00ae Kit (formerly: MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit; QIAGEN\u00ae catologue: 12888-100) is still\u00a0used if KingFisher instrumentation is not available, or if the sample set\u00a0contains less than 48 samples.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Items included in the extraction kit (for one 96 well extraction)<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) Bead plate<\/li>\n<li>(2) 1.0ml collection plates<\/li>\n<li>Sealing Tape<\/li>\n<li>Labeled solutions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important Considerations\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Normal diameter 1 ml pipet tips are too large for some of the pipetting steps.

Remember, each pipetting step will require 1 box of 96 tips per plate.<\/li>\n<li>We use presterilized reservoirs for pipetting steps carried out by epMotion\u00ae liquid handlers.<\/li>\n<li>When setting up the mechanical lysis, it is important that the plate not rub against any surfaces of\/in the plate shaker.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure that the alpha-numeric grid is in the same orientation across
