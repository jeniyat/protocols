Following entry, bacteria disrupt the invasion vacuole and reach the cytoplasm, where they replicate and use the actin cytoskeleton to propel themselves from cell to cell [1, 2]. To achieve this cytosolic lifestyle, <em>Listeria <\/em>deploys virulence effectors that hijack diverse cellular processes [3, 4]. Human epithelial cells grown <em>in vitro<\/em> can be used to study the <em>L.\u00a0monocyt<\/em>ogenes infectious process. However, rapid multiplication and dissemination of bacteria may induce cell death and detachment, thereby forming lytic plaques. Thus, <em>in vitro<\/em> infections with <em>L.\u00a0monocytogenes<\/em> have been restricted to short time courses (usually from a few minutes to one day). In order to study <em>L.\u00a0monocytogenes<\/em> long-term infections, we have set up a protocol, with several modifications to the gentamicin protection assay previously used for short-term infections with this pathogen [5]. In a subset of human cells, such as hepatocytes or trophoblast cells, this protocol enables to observe and study the entrapment of <em>L.\u00a0monocytogenes<\/em> within vacuoles, termed \u201cListeria-Containing Vacuoles\u201d (LisCVs), after the intercellular dissemination phase of <em>Listeria<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here, this protocol describes the assays used to study LisCVs in a JEG3 trophoblast cell monolayer.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":"<p>- Containment level: all manipulations with <em>L.\u00a0monocytogenes<\/em> must be conducted within a laminar flow class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC).<\/p>\n<p>- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): laboratory coat; gloves; safety glasses.
