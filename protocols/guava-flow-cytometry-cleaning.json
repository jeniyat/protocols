Blockages can be detected by the failure of the FCM to successfully plot data in the scatter plot even though the machine is in the \u2018acquire sample\u2019 step. This will be visualized on the scatter plot as either extreme alterations to the forward and side scatter plot (a Etch A Sketch like drawing) or a complete absence of cell populations that should be there otherwise. If blockages are not addressed immediately, counts will be significantly affected because the machine cannot tell when there is a blockage- it will think volume is passing through the flow cell when it isn\u2019t, which will artificially lower your cell counts.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"<p>It is extremely important to check the ICF vial for particulates and replace ICF if necessary.<\/p>","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"6819","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1499783793","protocol_affiliation":"","affiliation":"The University of Tennessee, Knoxville","doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.iwbcfan","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"Steven-w2w24423w2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/mageuxn.jpg","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/zappy-avatars\/13177_avatar.jpg","full_name":"Steven Wilhelm","created_by":"Steven Wilhelm","private_link":"B88AE455991DA282144578A10A08E133","original_img":"1","username":"steven-wilhelm","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":223347,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[{"group_id":"184","group_uri":"the-aquatic-microbial-ecology-research-group-amerg1","group_name":"The Aquatic Microbial Ecology Research Group - AMERG (The Buchan, Zinser and Wilhelm labs)","group_logo":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/dw3dg8n.jpg","requested_uid":null,"request_flag":null,"my_request":"1"}],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[{"tag_id":"512","tag_name":"flow cytometry"}],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"4","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/gold.svg","badge_description":"Gold power author!"},{"badge_id":"5","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/earlyadopter.svg","badge_description":"Early adopter"},{"badge_id":"6","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/socialbutterfly.svg","badge_description":"Social butterfly"}],"number_of_comments":0,"big_protocol_img":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/mafeuxn.jpg","big_protocol_img_ofn":"kyheuxn.jpg","is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Steven Wilhelm","authors_list":[{"name":"Steven Wilhelm","affiliation":null,"username":"steven-wilhelm","profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/zappy-avatars\/13177_avatar.jpg"}],"user":{"profile_image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/zappy-avatars\/13177_avatar.jpg","username":"steven-wilhelm","full_name":"Steven Wilhelm","created_by":"Steven Wilhelm"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"578700","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"B94A3B2A3B6C458F8FC66A62C0830830","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":null,"last_modified":"1499784169","components":[{"component_id":"959900","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"959688B10F904FB09E6B6D58086FF57A","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>Prior to the first run of the day, run a normal cleaning cycle.<\/p>","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"<p>Prior to the first run of the day, run a normal cleaning cycle.<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"959901","previous_id":"959900","original_id":"0","guid":"746AF7E007434450B6652FD58C80F27F","previous_guid":"959688B10F904FB09E6B6D58086FF57A","component_type_id":"6","data_id":null,"data":"","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"959902","previous_id":"959901","original_id":"0","guid":"DC92BB7A13BA430FB65F592E14F73EAD","previous_guid":"746AF7E007434450B6652FD58C80F27F","component_type_id":"26","data_id":"15872","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Note","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"26","source_data":{"annotation_id":"15872","thread_id":"15872","id":"15872","thread_title":"Annotation on step 1 of Guava Flow Cytometry Cleaning","uri":"annotation-on-step-1-of-guava-flow-cytometry-cleaning","thread_uri":"annotation-on-step-1-of-guava-flow-cytometry-cleaning","step_id":"578700","protocol_uri":"guava-flow-cytometry-cleaning-iwbcfan","protocol_name":"Guava Flow Cytometry Cleaning","protocol_name_html":"Guava Flow Cytometry Cleaning","annotation":"<p>If liquid cannot be seen flowing into the waste vial, there is an internal blockage.
