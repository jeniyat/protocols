As the sample migrates through the conjugate pad, it reconstitutes and mixes with the selenium colloid-antigen conjugate. This mixture continues to migrate through the solid phase to the immobilized recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides at the patient window site. If antibodies to HIV-1 and\/or HIV-2 are present in the sample, the antibodies bind to the antigen-selenium colloid and to the antigen at the patient window, forming a red line at the patient window site. If antibodies to HIV-1 and\/or HIV-2 are absent, the antigen-selenium colloid flows past the patient window, and no red line is formed at the patient window site. To insure assay validity, a procedural control bar is incorporated in the assay device.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In brief, 50 \u03bcL of sample was applied with precision pipette to the sample pad (marked by the arrow symbol).

To prevent any contamination, the Amplix\u00ae station 16 Dx combines ultraviolet light, a contamination shield to prevent liquid dripping, single-sample loading tubes to prevent cross-contamination, and a tip barrier to prevent convection-induced aerosol formation. The Amplix\u00ae viral extraction kit (Biosynex) for DNA\/RNA extraction integrates pre-filled buffer cartridge system containing all buffers, consumables and enzymes necessary for successful reaction in 90 minutes per run. Extracted nucleic acids were finally eluted in 50 \u00b5l of elution buffer.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Amplix\u00ae HIV-1 quantitative real-time PCR kit (Biosynex) targeting gag and LTR genes was used for detecting and quantifying HIV-1 RNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. During the pre-extraction processing, 10 \u00b5l of internal control (IC) is added to each plasma sample (190 \u00b5l), positive control (PC), weak positive control (WPC), negative control (NC) and, at first run of the kit, calibration samples (CS) 1 and CS2. The IC consists of mRNA of the human gene for GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The IC provides control of the whole amplification process, including sample RNA degradation (i.e. sample quality), efficiency of RNA extraction, and efficiency of reverse-transcription step and subsequent PCR amplification (i.e. PCR inhibition checking). For HIV-1 RNA quantification, a premix mixture was constituted by combining 50 \u00b5l of eluate and lyophilized PCR reagents. After sealing, the dedicated PCR tubes were mixed thoroughly by using mini spin centrifuge to dissolve the premix pellet with the nucleic acid extracts, and then subjected to amplification using real-time thermocycler Amplix\u00ae NG (Biosynex). The Amplix\u00ae NG uses thermal blocks in 48 wells format adapted to microplates, tubes and strips, light emitting diodes (LED) as a source of light (life-time of about 100,000 hours) and 4 channel of fluorescence detection for detection of HEX, FAM, CY5, ROX fluorescence dyes. The thermocycler is controlled by the Amplix\u00ae DTmaster software (Biosynex) used to depict and interpret final results of real-time PCR. For HIV-1 RNA quantification, the reaction mixture was subjected to uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) decontamination for 2 min at 37\u2103, reverse transcription during 5 min, then to 20 sec of initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C and 50 PCR cycles, each of 10 sec at 94\u2103 and 20 sec at 60\u2103, followed by a final cooling step of 10 min at 10\u2103.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Ct (cycle threshold) value for which PCR was defined as positive was less than 45. The IC detection used 2 channels capturing the fluorescence issued from hydrolysis probes (5'-fluorescein carboxylic acid [FAM] and 3'-black hole quencher-1 [BHQ1]). The HIV cDNA detection (plasma samples, PC, WPC, CS1 and CS2), used 2 channels capturing the fluorescence issued from hydrolysis of two other probes (5'-carboxy-rhodamine-X [ROX] and 3'-black hole quencher-1 [BHQ2]). The NC should show only FAM fluorescent signal increase and no significant ROX fluorescent increase (Ct value for NC along ROX channel less than 40 indicating contamination) (Figure 1 B and C). For a given plasma sample, the Amplix\u00ae DTmaster software (Biosynex) detect the amplification signal increase for IC cDNA (FAM channel), which is valid if Ct of IC for this sample is equal to or less than 40, and the fluorescence signal increase for HIV cDNA (ROX channel). The HIV-1 RNA load for a given sample k calculated by Amplix\u00ae DTmaster software is function of a B coefficient determined during initial calibration, the HIV-1 RNA load of the PC (specified in the passport of the kit), Ct of PC and Ct and sample k on ROX channel, and Ct of IC of PC and Ct of IC of sample k on FAM channel.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Abbott RealTi<em>m<\/em>e HIV-1<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular Inc, IL, USA) uses RT-PCR to generate amplified product from the RNA genome of HIV-1 in clinical specimens. An RNA sequence that is unrelated to the HIV-1 target sequence is introduced into each specimen at the beginning of sample preparation. This unrelated RNA sequence is simultaneously amplified by RT-PCR, and serves as an internal control (IC) to demonstrate that the process has proceeded correctly for each sample. The amount of HIV\u20111 target sequence that is present at each amplification cycle is measured through the use of fluorescent\u2011labeled oligonucleotide probes on the Abbott m2000rt instrument. The probes do not generate signal unless they are specifically bound to the amplified product. The amplification cycle at which fluorescent signal is detected by the Abbott m2000rt is proportional to the log of the HIV-1 RNA concentration present in the original sample. The target sequence for the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay is in the pol integrase region of the HIV-1 genome. This region is highly conserved. The Abbott RealTi<em>m<\/em>e Reagents are intended for single-use only and unused reagents should be discarded. 0.6 mL of sample volume was used for assay protocol as follow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thaw assay controls and IC at 15 to 30\u00b0C or at 2 to 8\u00b0C. Thaw calibrators at 15 to 30\u00b0C or at 2 to 8\u00b0C only if performing a calibration run; see quality control procedures section of this package insert for description of assay calibration. Once thawed, assay controls, IC, and calibrators can be stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C for up to 24 hours before use.<\/li>\n<li>Vortex each assay calibrator and each control 3 times for 2 to 3 seconds.
