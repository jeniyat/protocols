As the world\u2019s leader in incarceration, the United States incarcerated population is at higher risk for infectious diseases, mental illness, and substance use disorder. Previous studies indicate that the mortality rate for people coming out of prison is almost 13 times higher than that of the general population; opioids contribute to nearly 1 in 8 post-release fatalities overall, and almost half of all overdose deaths. Further, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health care are often interrelated difficulties and conflicting priorities for formerly incarcerated people. Given the interplay of incarceration, opioid use disorder (OUD), and social determinants of health, evidence is urgently needed on intersectional interventions to improve outcomes for this vulnerable group. We will conduct a systematic review of existing peer-reviewed literature published in the last 5 years that describe interventions for justice-involved people with OUD through a social-determinants lens. The purpose of this systematic review is to 1) identify interventions for opioid use disorder that are implemented as part of criminal justice system involvement, 2) determine which interventions also include a social determinants component, and 3) note any common elements between interventions with significant outcomes.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1579709162}
