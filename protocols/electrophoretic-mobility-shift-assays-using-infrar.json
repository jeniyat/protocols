An important technique for studying\u00a0these interactions is the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), whereby protein-DNA complexes are resolved on the basis of their mass:charge ratio using native polyacrylamide\u00a0gel electrophoresis (nPAGE).\u00a0Here we describe EMSA using PCR-generated, near infrared-fluorescent DNA probes,\u00a0and IR fluorescence imaging to qualitatively and quantitatively study the interaction of transcriptional regulatory proteins from\u00a0thermophilic organisms with different DNAs. Direct imaging of IR fluorophore-labeled DNA probes is advantageous because it\u00a0provides high sensitivity (subnanomolar) without the need for intermediate staining steps or costly and problematic radiolabeled probes,\u00a0thereby providing a more affordable and sensitive option to image protein-DNA on polyacrylamide gels by techniques such as EMSA.<\/div><\/div>"}
