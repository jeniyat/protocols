In this paper, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis on the collected videotapes and aim to provide a complete and unitary database of pedestrians' earthquake emergency response behaviors in indoor scenarios, including interactions between man and the environment. Using the qualitative analysis method, we extract keyword groups and keywords that code the response modes of pedestrians in indoor scenarios and construct a general decision flowchart using chronological organization. Using the quantitative analysis method, we analyze data on the delay time, evacuation speed, evacuation route and emergency exit choices. Furthermore, we study the effect of classroom layout on emergency evacuation. The database in indoor scenarios provides reliable input parameters and allows the construction of real and effective constraints for use in software and mathematical models. It can also be used to validate the accuracy of evacuation models.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"9431","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1515055196","protocol_affiliation":"Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration,","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.mfxc3pn","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y2x29413x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png","full_name":"Junxue Zhou","created_by":"Junxue Zhou","private_link":"82A7274650F5945BFFA33E6E142DA037","original_img":"1","username":"junxue-zhou","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":282033,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"Earthquake emergency response behavior,Database,Videotape,Seismic intensity,Evacuation","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"2","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/bronze.svg","badge_description":"Author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Junxue Zhou,Sha Li\uff0cGaozhong Nie","authors_list":[{"name":"Junxue Zhou","affiliation":"Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration","username":null,"profile_image":null},{"name":"Sha Li\uff0cGaozhong Nie","affiliation":null,"username":null,"profile_image":null}],"user":{"profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/004.png","username":"junxue-zhou","full_name":"Junxue Zhou","created_by":"Junxue Zhou"},"access":{"can_view":"1","can_remove":"0","can_add":"0","can_edit":0,"can_publish":0,"can_get_doi":0,"can_share":"0","can_move":"1","can_transfer":"1","can_download":"1","is_locked":"0"},"is_contact_suspended":0,"guidelines":null,"status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":"We use this protocol in our group and it is working","steps":[{"id":"601213","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"E82A01DF225E4ECE9388B406E0E60D09","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1515075679","components":[{"component_id":"1038198","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"9A566903B8B044DBBA06CA5BDBE2AE56","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"","order_id":"0","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":""},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"1038197","previous_id":"1038198","original_id":"0","guid":"D29CD92A9F704CA8B2929E3DF6962E6D","previous_guid":"9A566903B8B044DBBA06CA5BDBE2AE56","component_type_id":"1","data_id":null,"data":"<p>We collect social surveillance video footage taken during real earthquakes in mainland China, and we select 30 surveillance videos from the collected videos as the study data.
