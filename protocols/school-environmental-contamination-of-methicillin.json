Secondly, two elementary schools from each administrative district and eight schools were totally included. Thirdly, the number of class in grade four and five was proportionally and randomly selected. All schoolchildren that were with consent from each class were included in the study. Schoolchildren from grade four and five were selected due to their better compliance and less academic burden in China. Those who were absent or were excluded.
