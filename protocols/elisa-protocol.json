After receiving the kit, the Substrate should be stored at 4\u2070C. Other reagents are kept according to the labels on vials. But for long term storage, please keep the whole kit at -20\u2070C (Except the substrate). The unused strips should be kept in a sealed bag with the desiccant provided to minimize exposure to damp air. The test kit may be used throughout the expiration date of the kit (six months from the date of manufacture). Opened test kits will remain stable until the expiring date shown, provided it is stored as prescribed above.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sample Preparation <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>General considerations<\/strong>: extract samples as soon as possible after specimen collection. According to best practices, experiments should be carried out as soon as possible after the extraction. Alternatively, extract can be kept at -20\u2070C but for optimal results, avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Samples that contain NaN3 cannot be detected as it interferes with HRP.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Serum<\/strong>: Use a serum separator tube (SST) and allow samples to clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation for 15 minutes at approximately 1000 \u00d7 g. Remove serum and assay immediately or aliquot and store samples at -20\u2070C or -80\u2070C.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plasma<\/strong>: Collect plasma using EDTA or heparin as an anticoagulant. Centrifuge samples for 15 minutes at 1000 \u00d7 g at 2\u2070C - 8\u2070C within 30 minutes of collection. Store samples at -20\u2070C or -80\u2070C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Note: over hemolyzed samples are not suitable for use with this kit.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Urine<\/strong>: collect in a sterile container, centrifuge for 20 mins @ 2000-3000 rpm. Remove supernatant and if any precipitation is detected repeat centrifugation step. A similar protocol can be used for cerebrospinal fluid.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong> Cell culture supernatant<\/strong>: collect supernatant and centrifuge @ 4\u2070C for 20 mins @ 2000-3000 rpm. Remove supernatant and rinse cells x2 times with PBS (pH 7.2-7.4) and perform a total cell count. Optimal cell concentration is 1 million \/ ml. To release cellular components, dilute the cell pellet in PBS and use 3-4 freeze-thaw cycles in liquid Nitrogen (commercial lyses buffers can be used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions). Centrifuge @ 4\u2070C for 20 mins @ 2000-3000 rpm to pellet debris and remove clear supernatant to clean microcentrifuge tube for ELISA or storage.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tissue samples<\/strong>: the preparation of tissue homogenates will vary depending upon tissue type. For this assay, tissue was rinsed with 1X PBS to remove excess blood, homogenized in 20mL of 1X PBS and stored overnight at \u2264 -20\u2070C After two freeze-thaw cycles were performed to break the cell membranes, the homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5000 x g.

Samples to be used within 5 days may be stored at 2-8\u2070C , otherwise samples must be stored at - 20\u2070C (1 month) or -80\u2070C (2 months) to avoid loss of bioactivity and contamination.<\/p>\n<p>2. Tissue or cell extraction samples prepared by chemical lysis buffer may cause unexpected ELISA results due to the impacts of certain chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>3. Influenced by the factors including cell viability, cell number and also sampling time, samples from cell culture supernatant may not be detected by the kit<\/p>\n<p>4. Sample hemolysis will influence the result, so hemolytic specimen cannot be detected.<\/p>\n<p>5.

After it dissolves fully, mix it thoroughly with a pipette. This reconstitution produces a stock solution. Make serial dilutions as needed (making serial dilution in the wells directly is not recommended). The undiluted stock serves as the standard with the highest concentration. The Sample Diluent serves as the zero blank (0 pg\/mL).

If values for these are not within the range of the standard curve, users must determine the optimal sample dilutions for their particular experiments. We recommend running all samples in duplicate.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional Information on protocol<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1. Absorbance is a function of the incubation time. Therefore, prior to starting the assay it is recommended that all reagents should be freshly prepared prior to use and all required strip-wells are secured in the microtiter frame. This will ensure equal elapsed time for each pipetting step, without interruption.<\/p>\n<p>2. Please carefully reconstitute Standards or working Detection Reagent A and B according to the instruction, and avoid foaming and mix gently until the crystals have completely dissolved. The reconstituted Standards Detection Reagent A and B can be used only once. This assay requires pipetting of small volumes. To minimize imprecision caused by pipetting, ensure that pipettors are calibrated.<\/p>\n<p>3. To ensure accurate results, proper adhesion of plate sealers during incubation steps is necessary. Do not allow wells to sit uncovered for extended periods between incubation steps. Once reagents have been added to the well strips, DO NOT let the strips DRY at any time during the assay.<\/p>\n<p>4. For each step in the procedure, total dispensing time for addition of reagents to the assay plate should not exceed 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>5. To avoid cross-contamination, change pipette tips between additions of each standard level, between sample additions, and between reagent additions. Also, use separate reservoirs for each reagent.<\/p>\n<p>6. The wash procedure is critical. Insufficient washing will result in poor precision and falsely elevated absorbance readings.<\/p>\n<p>7. Duplication of all standards and specimens, although not required, is recommended.<\/p>\n<p>8. Substrate Solution is easily contaminated. Please protect it from light.<\/p>\n<p>9. If samples generate values higher than the highest standard, further dilute the samples with the Sample Diluent and repeat the assay. Any variation in standard diluent, operator, pipetting technique, washing technique, incubation time, temperature or kit age can cause variation in binding.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Average the duplicate readings for each standard, control, and sample and subtract the average zero standard optical density. Create a standard curve by reducing the data using computer software capable of generating a four parameter logistic (4-PL) curve-fit. As an alternative, construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for each standard on the x-axis against the concentration on the y-axis and draw a best fit curve through the points on the graph. The data may be linearized by 9 plotting the log of the protein concentrations versus the log of the O.D. and the best fit line can be determined by regression analysis. It is recommended to use some related software to do this calculation, such as curve expert 1.3. This procedure will produce an adequate but less precise fit of the data. If samples have been diluted, the concentration read from the standard curve must be multiplied by the dilution factor.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/fmac3aw.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/fmac3aw.png\" data-ofn=\"Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2016-10-20 a\u0300 11.03.04.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Important General Notes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1. The final experimental results will be closely related to validity of the products, laboratory skills of the end-users and the experimental conditions. Please make sure that sufficient samples are available.<\/p>\n<p>2. Kits from different batches may be a little different in detection range, sensitivity and color developing time. Please perform the experiment exactly according to the instructions.<\/p>\n<p>3. There may be some foggy substance in the wells when the plate is opened at the first time. It will not have any effect on the final assay results.<\/p>\n<p>4. Do not remove microtiter plate from the storage bag until needed.<\/p>\n<p>5. A microtiter plate reader with a bandwidth of 10nm or less and an optical density range of 0-3 OD or greater at 450nm wavelength is acceptable for use in absorbance measurement.<\/p>\n<p>6. Use fresh disposable pipette tips for each liquid transfer to avoid contamination.<\/p>\n<p>7. Do not substitute reagents from one kit lot to another. Use only the reagents supplied by manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p>8. In order to achieve reproducible results, the operation of every step in the assay should be controlled. Furthermore, a preliminary experiment before every assay for each batch is recommended.<\/p>\n<p>9. Each kit has been strictly passed Q.C tested. However, results from end-users might be inconsistent with our in-house data due to some unexpected transportation conditions or different lab equipment. Intra-assay variance among kits from different batches might arise from aforementioned factors. Safety Precaution 1. The Stop Solution suggested for use with this kit is an acid solution.
