Coyote scat will be collected from survey blocks within green spaces in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties on a monthly basis over the next two years. Twenty five survey blocks will be identified which represent a fairly even spatial distribution over the city. Access to these spaces will be secured through communication with landowners. Coyote scat will be collected as thoroughly as possible from a transect within each of these blocks by a team of trained volunteers using rubber gloves and paper bags once monthly. The paper bag corresponding with each scat sample will be labelled with site name, date, and either GPS coordinates or a location estimate, along with the name of the volunteer collecting. The scats will be sterilized by baking them for 24 hours at 60\u00b0C, washed and dried, and then analyzed by a combination of NPS and trained volunteers to identify diet. Results will be compiled and analyzed.\n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Goal<\/span><span>: Obtain sufficient coyote scat samples to study the diet of coyotes within the urban and suburban landscapes of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and how this changes seasonally.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">\n<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Study Area<\/span><span>: Los Angeles (~34\u00b03\u20190\u201d N, 118\u00b015\u20190\u201d W; Los Angeles County); the Conejo Valley cities of Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, and Agoura Hills (~34\u00b011\u201922\u201d N, 118\u00b052\u201930\u201d W; Los Angeles and Ventura Counties)\n\n<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Survey Blocks<\/span><span>: Within each green space identified, we will select one or more survey block.

They will usually contain animal bones, fur, claws, or teeth; seeds; vegetation; or evidence of human food (e.g., candy wrappers, string, tin foil). Coyote scats are typically tapered on the ends, and often have a characteristic twisted appearance. Coyote scat are usually deposited on trails or paths, or in other areas that wildlife are using to travel (likely not in thick dense brush).\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>    The main issue in Los Angeles is differentiating between dog scat and coyote scat. <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Dog scat is not to be collected<\/span><span>. For the purposes of this study, only collect scat which contains a significant amount of animal fur or vegetation, or any bones, claws, teeth, seeds, or obvious signs of human-related items. Volunteers are encouraged to gently pick apart scats to aid identification as long as all of the contents make it into the paper bags. Dog scat is usually larger (but can also be smaller or the same size), is more blunt at each end, and will be very uniform in consistency due to the diet of dog food. Some dog scat will have a small amount of dog hair in it, because dogs lick themselves. Some dog scat will also contain little flecks of corn, a component of most dog food, which ends up looking a lot like small seeds- the corn will be more randomly assorted shapes and sizes, and will usually be tan to orange.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    Bobcat scat may be present at suburban (i.e., Ventura County) scat lines. It is about the size of coyote scat, but has a very characteristic \u2018ball and socket\u2019 pattern: when broken at a joint, one side of the scat will have a rounded end and the other will have an indentation. In addition, bobcat scat often includes \u2018token\u2019 scats (small spherical scats.) Bobcat scat will always include fur or bones. If the volunteers are unsure whether a scat is bobcat or coyote, have them collect it and add a large, clear, \u201cPOSSIBLY BOBCAT\u201d label on the paper bag.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Entering Into the Database and Cross-Checking the Database<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Each scat must be entered into the online database.

Park Service staff of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to facilitate the training of citizen science volunteers to collect and analyze coyote scat for the Los Angeles Urban Coyote

This protocol provides instructions for the scat project managers to supervise volunteers and train them on how to:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Walk a scat transect and collect scat<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Identify coyote scat in the field<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Dissect scat<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Identify major prey items<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In addition, sections of this protocol detail actions carried out by NPS staff, such as volunteer supervision and quality control, and the protocol for sterilizing and washing scats.
