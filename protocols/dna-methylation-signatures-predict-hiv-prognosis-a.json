The application of a machine learning approach to the analysis of CpG methylation in the epigenome enables the selection of phenotypically relevant features from high-dimensional data. Using this approach, we now report that a set of smoking-associated DNA-methylated CpGs predicts HIV prognosis and mortality in an HIV-positive veteran population.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods and Findings <\/span><span>A total of 1,137 DNA samples were extracted from WBCs in HIV-positive male veterans. Here, HIV prognosis was measured by Veteran Aging Cohort Study Index that was highly correlated with HIV disease frailty. We first conducted two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for tobacco smoking in two HIV-positive sample sets. We then selected smoking-associated DNA methylation features using a machine learning approach to differentiate good and poor HIV prognosis and to predict mortality. The performance of the prediction was validated in an independent sample set. We identified137epigenome-widesignificant CpGs in meta-EWAS analysis for smoking in HIV-positive samples (p < 1.70E-07). Using an in-house developed bioinformatic pipeline, we selected 698 CpG sites that predicted high HIV frailty [(Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.73, (95%CI: 0.63 ~ 0.83)] and was replicated in an independent sample [(AUC = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.73 ~ 0.83)]. We further found an association of a DNA methylation index constructed from the 698-CpGs that were associated with a 5-year survival rate [HR =1.46; 95%CI: 1.06 ~ 2.02, p = 0.02]. Interestingly, the 698-CpGs located on 445 genes were enriched on the integrin signaling pathway (p=9.55E-05, False discovery rate=0.036), which is responsible for regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, and adhesion.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><span>We demonstrated that smoking-associated DNA methylation features in white blood cells predict HIV infection prognosis and mortality in a population living with HIV.
