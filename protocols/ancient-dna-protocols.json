Read quality was assessed with FastQC (S. Andrews 2016). Sequences shorter than 25 nucleotide were removed from this dataset. The resulting analysis-ready reads were mapped to the GRCh37.75 human genome reference sequence using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v0.7.9 software (Li and Durbin 2009) with the BWA mem algorithm in paired mode and default parameters. Aligning to the GRCh37.75 human reference genome that also contains the mtDNA revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS, NC_012920.1) (R. M. Andrews et al. 1999) helped to avoid the forced false alignment of homologous nuclear mitochondrial sequences (NumtS) to rCRS, though the proportion of NumtS, derived from low copy nuclear genome, is expexted to be orders of magnitudes lower than mtDNA in aDNA libraries. Samtools v1.1 (Li et al. 2009) was used for sorting and indexing BAM files. PCR duplicates were removed with Picard Tools v 1.113 (Broad Institute 2016). Ancient DNA damage patterns were assessed using MapDamage 2.0 (J\u00f3nsson et al. 2013), and read quality scores were modified with the rescale option to account for post-mortem damage. Freebayes v1.02 (Garrison and Marth 2012) was used to identify variants and generate variant call format (VCF) files with the parameters -q 10 (exclude nucleotids with &lt;10 phred quality) and -P 0.5 (exclude very low probability variants). Each variant call was also inspected manually. From VCF files FASTA format was generated with the Genom Analysis Tool Kit (GATK v3.5) FastaAlternateReferenceMaker walker (McKenna et al. 2010).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>References: <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Andrews, R M et al. 1999. \u201cReanalysis and Revision of the Cambridge Reference Sequence for Human Mitochondrial DNA.\u201d <em>Nature genetics<\/em> 23(2): 147. http:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;&gt;<\/p>\n<p>Andrews, S. 2016. \u201cFastQC: A Quality Control Tool for High Throughput Sequence Data.\u201d <em>babraham bioinformatics<\/em>. http:\/\/www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk\/projects\/fastqc.<\/p>\n<p>Broad Institute. 2016. \u201cPicard Tools.\u201d <em>https:\/\/broadinstitute.github.io\/picard\/<\/em>. http:\/\/broadinstitute.github.io\/picard\/.<\/p>\n<p>Damgaard, Peter B et al. 2015. \u201cImproving Access to Endogenous DNA in Ancient Bones and Teeth.\u201d <em>Scientific Reports<\/em> 5: 11184. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep11184%5Cn10.1038\/srep11184%5Cnhttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep11184#supplementary-information.<\/p>\n<p>Gamba, Cristina et al. 2016. \u201cComparing the Performance of Three Ancient DNA Extraction Methods for High-Throughput Sequencing.\u201d <em>Molecular Ecology Resources<\/em> 16(2): 459\u201369.<\/p>\n<p>Garrison, Erik, and Gabor Marth. 2012. \u201cHaplotype-Based Variant Detection from Short-Read Sequencing.\u201d <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.3907<\/em>: 9. http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1207.3907.<\/p>\n<p>Haak, Wolfgang et al. 2010. \u201cAncient DNA from European Early Neolithic Farmers Reveals Their near Eastern Affinities.\u201d <em>PLoS Biology<\/em> 8(11).<\/p>\n<p>J\u00f3nsson, H\u00e1kon et al. 2013. \u201cMapDamage2.0: Fast Approximate Bayesian Estimates of Ancient DNA Damage Parameters.\u201d In <em>Bioinformatics<\/em>, , 1682\u201384.<\/p>\n<p>Kircher, Martin, Susanna Sawyer, and Matthias Meyer. 2012. \u201cDouble Indexing Overcomes Inaccuracies in Multiplex Sequencing on the Illumina Platform.\u201d <em>Nucleic Acids Research<\/em> 40(1).<\/p>\n<p>Li, Heng et al. 2009. \u201cThe Sequence Alignment\/Map Format and SAMtools.\u201d <em>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)<\/em> 25(16): 2078\u201379. http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/long\/25\/16\/2078 (August 20, 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Li, Heng, and Richard Durbin. 2009. \u201cFast and Accurate Short Read Alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform.\u201d <em>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)<\/em> 25(14): 1754\u201360. http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/long\/25\/14\/1754 (August 22, 2016).<\/p>\n<p>Llamas, Bastien et al. 2017. \u201cFrom the Field to the Laboratory: Controlling DNA Contamination in Human Ancient DNA Research in the High-Throughput Sequencing Era.\u201d <em>STAR: Science &amp; Technology of Archaeological Research<\/em> 3(1): 1\u201314. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/20548923.2016.1258824.<\/p>\n<p>Maricic, T, M Whitten, and S P\u00e4\u00e4bo. 2010. \u201cMultiplexed DNA Sequence Capture of Mitochondrial Genomes Using PCR Products.\u201d <em>PLoS ONE<\/em> 5: e14004. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0014004.<\/p>\n<p>Martin, Marcel. 2011. \u201cCutadapt Removes Adapter Sequences from High-Throughput Sequencing Reads.\u201d <em>EMBnet.journal<\/em> 17(1): 10\u201312.<\/p>\n<p>McKenna, Aaron et al. 2010. \u201cThe Genome Analysis Toolkit: A MapReduce Framework for Analyzing next-Generation DNA Sequencing Data.\u201d <em>Genome Research<\/em> 20(9): 1297\u20131303.<\/p>\n<p>Meyer, Matthias, and Martin Kircher. 2010. \u201cIllumina Sequencing Library Preparation for Highly Multiplexed Target Capture and Sequencing.\u201d <em>Cold Spring Harbor Protocols<\/em> 5(6).<\/p>\n<p>Rohland, Nadin et al. 2015. \u201cPartial Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase Treatment for Screening of Ancient DNA.\u201d <em>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
