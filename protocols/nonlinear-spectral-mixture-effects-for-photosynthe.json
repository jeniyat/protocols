This region consists of temperate continental arid climate zones, and the natural vegetation is mainly desert vegetation. A key characteristic of the desert vegetation is that it contains few species, and only a few layers are present with a simple structure and low productivity. <em>Nitraria<\/em> is short (1\u20132 m in the mature stage) with an open canopy structure, and it is a type of shrub [20, 21], as shown in <strong>Fig 1<\/strong>. <em>Nitraria<\/em> shrubs are relatively resistant to sandy and salty conditions and serve as windbreaks across the landscape. These shrubs form a natural ecological barrier in oasis environments in the arid region of western China [22]. <em>Haloxylon<\/em> is tall (1\u20139 m in the mature stage) with a compact canopy structure, and it is a xeric adapted plant [23, 24] (<strong>Fig <\/strong><strong>1<\/strong>).

For each of the experimental plots, plot-specific bare soil (BS), shadow, PV, and NPV endmembers were defined and used in further analyses. In this research, spectra data for each endmember and canopy mixed spectral were obtained from ground-based field experiments; this involved obtaining specific PV\/NPV\/BS\/shadow endmember spectra in each sample plot so that we could remove the effect of variability among the endmember spectra [11]. Reflectance spectral measurements were acquired on August 25, 2014 (a clear-sky day), within 1 h of local solar noon by using a full-range (350\u20132500 nm) spectroradiometer with a 25\u00b0 ASD (Analytic Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO) Spec Pro Field spectrometer. The reflectance was calibrated by using a white spectral panel (Labsphere Inc., North Sutton, NH). During windless, cloudless, and full sunshine conditions, we collected data throughout a stable time period (10:00\u201314:00) from 20 <em>Nitraria<\/em> plots and 20 <em>Haloxylon<\/em> plots with different ratios of PV to NPV cover, and we measured the canopy spectra and the pure endmembers spectra, as shown in <strong>Fig 2<\/strong>. We used an orthogonal ruler to determine the center of the plots, and we marked out 1 m diameter circular area to ensure the sample range was consistent. Measurements were taken from nadir at a height of 2.3 m above the earth\u2019s surface, which resulted in a field of view (FOV) or a pixel\/plot diameter of 1 m from which we obtained the mixed spectral data for the fields, as illustrated in <strong>Fig 2<\/strong>; meanwhile, we placed the probe above the various typical species endmember surfaces (e.g., <em>Nitraria<\/em>, <em>Haloxylon<\/em>, dry branches, fine sand, shadows) between 0.1 m and 0.02 m so that pure endmember spectra were acquired in each field, as illustrated in <strong>Fig <\/strong><strong>2<\/strong>.

The photograph with higher quality will be selected, so that the photograph could be used to get the reference fraction accurately. Information on the ground cover composition of each of the measured mixed pixels was extracted from the digital photographs (positioned at nadir) so that the ground cover fraction distribution could be determined. As shown in <strong>Fig 3<\/strong>a, two cross rulers were used to mark the FOV while the digital image sensor was used to obtain RGB (red, green, and blue) photographs. According to the training samples for supervised classification, neural network classification (NNC) was applied to classify the digital photos with ENVI 5.3 software[26], and this yielded the 3-EM classes (<strong>Fig 3<\/strong>b) and 4-EM classes (<strong>Fig 3<\/strong>c). The classification results were validated through visual interpretations. The observed endmember cover would not contribute equally to the ASD probe due to the point spread function (PSF) of the ASD sensor. Hence, it was necessary to calibrate the fractional cover.<\/p>\n<p>The PSF is the Gaussian function, , where <em>d <\/em>is the distance from a pixel center (the unit is in meters) and \u03c3 illustrates the instantaneous FOV (IFOV) of a detector, which means that measurements closer to the center of the FOV will contribute more to the mixed reflectance signal, and thus, more weight should be given to the objects in the center. Each binary classified image was convolved with a Gaussian filter (i.e., <em>PSF<\/em> of the ASD sensor) to compute weighted averages of the image as shown in the <strong>Fig 3<\/strong>d. Endmember reference fractions could as such be expressed as a function of their actual contribution to the mixed pixel reflectance. Extensive research on this issue has been conducted by Settle [27] and Somers [28]. According to the PSF model, \u03c3 is 0.4363, which corresponds to a 25\u00b0 IFOV for the ASD transformed to radians. Here, all the actual ground cover fractions were corrected to correspond to the PSF of the ASD sensor. In summary, all the classification images were convolved with a Gaussian filter, and then, the weighted average adjusted fractions of two photographs were taken as the reference fraction for the different endmembers in a plot.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src=\"D:\\hyperion_paper\\minqin_paper\\Plos_one_ss\\\u4e00\u5ba1\u4fee\u6539\\\u4e00\u5ba1\u4fee\u6539\u63d0\u4ea4\\Fig3.tif\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Fig <\/strong><strong>3<\/strong><strong>.

We have constructed the LSMM (Eq. (1)) based on the principles of linear mixtures[13, 31-36]. The mixed spectra of the LSMM can be regarded as the linear combination of the endmember spectral response. In its general form, the LSMM can be described as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)<\/p>\n<p>where<em> R<sub>i<\/sub><\/em> is the measured reflectance of a mixed pixel in spectral band <em>i<\/em>; <em>f<\/em><em><sub>j<\/sub> <\/em>is the sub-pixel cover fraction of the <em>j<\/em>th endmember in the pixel; and <em>W<sub>i,j<\/sub><\/em> is the <em>j<\/em>th endmember reflectance for spectral band<em> i<\/em>; <em>m <\/em>is the number of the endmembers.

By doing this, combinations of the original endmember spectral bands (i.e., some high-order multiplications of the original spectral bands) are now consisted of the components of each mapped endmember in the high-dimensional feature space. Therefore, the nonlinear mixture model is still linear and additive in the feature space but includes nonlinear components of the endmember spectral bands in the original input space [43-47].<\/p>\n<p>Generally, the nonlinear mapping <em>\u00a0<\/em>is unknown and may be complicated. Kernel-based learning algorithms use an effective kernel trick to implement dot products in feature space by employing some kernel functions[48]. The kernel representation for the dot products in <em>H<\/em> is expressed as:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10)<\/p>\n<p>Then everywhere that <em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em><sub>\u00b7<\/sub><em>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em> occurs, we replace it with<em> K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>, <em>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>). Theoretically, any function that satisfies the Mercer\u2019s theorem[49, 50] or the Positive definite can be used as a kernel function. A Mercer Kernel is symmetric (<em>K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>,<em> x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>) = <em>K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>, <em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>)) and positive definite ((<em>K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>,<em> x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>) &gt;0)). By Mercer\u2019s theorem, any symmetric positive definite kernel represents the inner product in some higher-dimensional Hibert Space[50, 51]. According to the simple structure characteristics of the surface vegetation in the study area, we used two common kernel functions, namely, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the polynomial kernel function (PKF). The RBF and PKF were chosen due to their successful applications to non-linear unmixing in the scalar value case[46, 52]. RBF represents the case where an endless number of re\ufb02ections occurs since it incorporates all higher order interactions between the input spectra, while PKF define the interactions order and has a relatively explicit physical meaning.

The parameter \u03c3 in the RBF is determined by the gradient descent method [53], and it was determined to 200 with the four endmember (4-EM) models and to 20 with the three endmember (3-EM) models in the <em>Nitraria<\/em> shrubs plots, and to 152 with the 4-EM models and to 200 with the 3-EM models in the <em>Haloxylon<\/em> plots.

The training data are split into <em>k<\/em> parts of size l\/<em>k<\/em>. A discrete range of possible values of the kernel functions parameter is chosen and for each parameter value a spectral unmixing is trained using <em>k<\/em>-1 parts and tested on the remaining 1 part from which a model unmixing accuracy is measured since we know the labels of the data. This is repeated one by one through all <em>k<\/em> such splits of the training data into <em>k<\/em>-1 folds for training with testing on the remaining fold, and an average model unmixing accuracy is obtained. This is repeated for each of the parameter values and the value with the highest model unmixing accuracy is chosen.

In its general form, the LSMM can be described as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)<\/p>\n<p>where<em> R<sub>i<\/sub><\/em> is the measured reflectance of a mixed pixel in spectral band <em>i<\/em>; <em>f<\/em><em><sub>j<\/sub> <\/em>is the sub-pixel cover fraction of the <em>j<\/em>th endmember in the pixel; and <em>W<sub>i,j<\/sub><\/em> is the <em>j<\/em>th endmember reflectance for spectral band<em> i<\/em>; <em>m <\/em>is the number of the endmembers. Based on the measured pixel spectral vector R and the endmembers\u2019 spectral vector W, and this is done under the constraints that for j = 1, \u2026, m (ANC) and \u00a0(ASC). Since every pixel spectral, R, is acquired by spectral channels at different wavelengths, it can be represented by a column vector of which each component is a pixel in a plot. By making use of Eq. (1), the endmember fraction <em>f<\/em><em><sub>j<\/sub><\/em> estimates are obtained by the fully constrained least squares (FCLS) [37, 38] , for which the following equation is minimized:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)<\/p>\n<p>where <em>n<\/em> is the number of effective spectral bands; and. is the spectral model error.

By doing this, combinations of the original endmember spectral bands (i.e., some high-order multiplications of the original spectral bands) are now consisted of the components of each mapped endmember in the high-dimensional feature space. Therefore, the nonlinear mixture model is still linear and additive in the feature space but includes nonlinear components of the endmember spectral bands in the original input space [43-47].<\/p>\n<p>Generally, the nonlinear mapping <em>\u00a0<\/em>is unknown and may be complicated. Kernel-based learning algorithms use an effective kernel trick to implement dot products in feature space by employing some kernel functions[48]. The kernel representation for the dot products in <em>H<\/em> is expressed as:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10)<\/p>\n<p>Then everywhere that <em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em><sub>\u00b7<\/sub><em>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em> occurs, we replace it with<em> K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>, <em>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>). Theoretically, any function that satisfies the Mercer\u2019s theorem[49, 50] or the Positive definite can be used as a kernel function. A Mercer Kernel is symmetric (<em>K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>,<em> x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>) = <em>K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>, <em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>)) and positive definite ((<em>K<\/em>(<em>x<sub>i<\/sub><\/em>,<em> x<sub>j<\/sub><\/em>) &gt;0)). By Mercer\u2019s theorem, any symmetric positive definite kernel represents the inner product in some higher-dimensional Hibert Space[50, 51]. According to the simple structure characteristics of the surface vegetation in the study area, we used two common kernel functions, namely, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the polynomial kernel function (PKF). The RBF and PKF were chosen due to their successful applications to non-linear unmixing in the scalar value case[46, 52]. RBF represents the case where an endless number of re\ufb02ections occurs since it incorporates all higher order interactions between the input spectra, while PKF define the interactions order and has a relatively explicit physical meaning.

Because the training sample data is different for the different models and the different types of vegetation, the optimal parameters value of the kernel function is different. The parameter \u03c3 in the RBF is determined by the gradient descent method [53], and it was determined to 200 with the four endmember (4-EM) models and to 20 with the three endmember (3-EM) models in the <em>Nitraria<\/em> shrubs plots, and to 152 with the 4-EM models and to 200 with the 3-EM models in the <em>Haloxylon<\/em> plots. The parameters of PKF are determined by the Cross validation [54-57] which means that the fitting process\u00a0optimizes\u00a0the model parameters to make the model fit the input data as well as possible. The training data are split into <em>k<\/em> parts of size l\/<em>k<\/em>. A discrete range of possible values of the kernel functions parameter is chosen and for each parameter value a spectral unmixing is trained using <em>k<\/em>-1 parts and tested on the remaining 1 part from which a model unmixing accuracy is measured since we know the labels of the data. This is repeated one by one through all <em>k<\/em> such splits of the training data into <em>k<\/em>-1 folds for training with testing on the remaining fold, and an average model unmixing accuracy is obtained. This is repeated for each of the parameter values and the value with the highest model unmixing accuracy is chosen.

The spectral mixture model fit was checked by using the unmixing error of the spectral mixture model, the PV\/NPV\/BS\/shadow ground validation RMSE (Eq. (16))[40], the <em>R<\/em><sup>2<\/sup> (Eq. (17)) [7], and the Relative RMSE (RRMSE) (Eq. (18))[61]. The use of the RMSE of the spectral mixture model is mainly aimed at validating the accuracy of the model in unmixing the mixture spectral. The RMSE of endmembers was calculated to quantify the difference between the measured fraction and estimated fraction for the fields. RRMSE is a measure of the deviation rate with percent as the unit, and values closer to zero are indicative of a better fit. The relevant equations are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (16)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (17)<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (18)<\/p>\n<p>where RMSE is the root mean square error, <em>R<\/em><sup>2<\/sup> is the square of the correlation coefficient, RRMSE is the deviation rate of the estimated model spectral value or estimated cover fraction of endmembers,<em> n<\/em> is the number of fields or available wavebands,<em> x<\/em><em><sub>i<\/sub><\/em> is the estimated cover fraction or the estimated mixing spectral value of the<em> i<\/em>th field, <em>y<\/em><em><sub>i<\/sub><\/em> is the measured cover fraction or measured mixing spectral value of the<em> i<\/em>th field, is the average value of the estimated cover fractions, and \u00a0is the average value of the measured cover fractions.<\/p>"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"918090","previous_id":"918091","original_id":"0","guid":"6DB1DC1F9C66491795E895BD558748CC","previous_guid":"57C0A0AE7A2C41D4BFAE18EDA90D1ED6","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"Data and Methods","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"Data and Methods"},"is_project":0}]}]}
