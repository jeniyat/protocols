When working with lytic phage, well-isolated, cleared areas in a lawn of bacteria (called plaques) are removed from the agar (by coring with a sterile pipette) and used to infect fresh bacteria in liquid medium.&nbsp; The lysed culture can be used for a new plaque assay after 0.2 um filtering to remove residual bacteria.&nbsp; New phage are \"plaque-purified\" a minimum of three times before they are considered to be free of other phage.","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":"","has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":"","version_class":"857","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1434574830","protocol_affiliation":"Matthew
