This extrusion protocol roughly follows <a href=\"https:\/\/avantilipids.com\/divisions\/equipment\/mini-extruder-extrusion-technique\/\" target=\"_blank\">some guidelines published by the manufacturer<\/a>. However, we found that the manufacturer's directions were insufficient in several areas. In particular, the manufacturer guidance on initial preparation of lipids was incomplete; 'good' liposomes cannot be prepared directly from dry lipid mixtures. In addition, our protocol provides supplementary guidance for extrusion and suspension of different classes of polar lipids; efficacy of the various matrixes we recommend was largely determined through trial and error. The manufacturer directions (downloaded March 4, 2017) are attached to this protocol as a .pdf document.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This protocol was original created by <a href=\"&quot;http:\/\/www.whoi.edu\/sbl\/liteSite.do?litesite\" target=\"_blank\">Krista Longnecker<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/jamesrco.github.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Collins<\/a> for creating lipsomes to be used in lipid photo-oxidation experiments.
