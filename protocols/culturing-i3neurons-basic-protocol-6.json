Primary astrocytes expanded in DMEM + 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) from post-natal (P0-3) mice or rats are sufficient for these purposes, provided that they are low-passage (< p3 post-harvest). Astrocytes can also be frozen in aliquots after expansion and thawed immediately prior to co-culture with partially differentiated neurons at d3.
