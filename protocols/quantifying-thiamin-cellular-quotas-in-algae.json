The chemical assay used \u2013 the thiochrome assay - was developed in the 1930s but has<br \/>been modified over the decades to include instrumentation with improved detection (Backstrom et<br \/>al. 1995, Reddick et al. 2001). The assay is based on cyclization\/oxidation of thiamin to<br \/>thiochrome under basic conditions in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as potassium<br \/>ferricyanide. Thiochrome is intensely fluorescent and easy to detect and quantify with high<br \/>sensitivity in an HPLC assay. This method has previously been used to determine cellular quotas<br \/>of thiamin and its different phosphorylation states in algae from brackish waters (Pinto et al. 2002,<br \/>Sylvander et al. 2013).<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"8110","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1507066291","protocol_affiliation":"MBARI,TAMU","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.j6ncrde","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"x2z2c4w2x2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/010.png","full_name":"Sebastian Sudek","created_by":"Sebastian Sudek","private_link":"21CCD8794D758F4E3B080054CE4D2D38","original_img":"1","username":"sebastian-sudek","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":"<p>Globally Important Haptophyte Algae Use Exogenous Pyrimidine Compounds More Efficiently than Thiamin<br \/>Magdalena A.
