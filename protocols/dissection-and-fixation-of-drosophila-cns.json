To improve the chemical tagging of neurons, we synthesized and evaluated new fluorophore ligands based on Cy, Janelia Fluor, Alexa Fluor, and ATTO dyes and tested these with recently improved <em>Drosophila melanogaster<\/em> transgenes. We found that tissue clearing and mounting in DPX substantially improves signal quality when combined with specific non-cyanine fluorophores. We compared and combined this labeling technique with standard immunohistochemistry in the Drosophila brain.<\/p>","is_bookmarked":"0","can_reassign":"1","before_start":null,"has_guidelines":"0","materials":[],"warning":null,"version_class":"12632","public":"1","is_owner":"1","is_original_owner":"1","created_on":"1527705436","protocol_affiliation":"Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, Virginia, USA,Division of Neurobiology, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 0QH, United Kingdom","affiliation":null,"doi":"dx.doi.org\/10.17504\/protocols.io.qjydupw","doi_status":"2","changed_fork_steps":null,"profile_url":"y203c4y2q2","protocol_img":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/default_protocol.png","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/018.png","full_name":"Geoffrey Meissner","created_by":"Geoffrey Meissner","private_link":"CA46B8D4CBE13EBE9F5F6EF3BE552800","original_img":"1","username":"geoffrey-meissner","is_retracted":"0","retraction_reason":null,"plos_id":null,"manuscript_citation":null,"journal_name":null,"is_donations_disabled":"0","is_donations_disabled_by_user":"9","item_record_id":318548,"fork_info":[],"compare_forks":[],"protocols":[],"groups":[],"number_of_shared_runs":[],"ownership_history":[],"keywords":"","transfer_to_user":[],"sub_transfer":false,"is_transfer_pending":false,"number_of_bookmarks":"0","collections":[],"tags":[],"archived":0,"sub_authors":[],"sub_protocols_number":0,"can_edit_shared":0,"shared_runs":[],"is_shared_run":0,"is_shared":1,"banner":null,"contact_badges":[{"badge_id":"3","badge_image":"\/img\/badges\/silver.svg","badge_description":"Power author!"}],"number_of_comments":0,"is_locked":0,"is_locked_by":false,"authors":"Geoffrey W.
