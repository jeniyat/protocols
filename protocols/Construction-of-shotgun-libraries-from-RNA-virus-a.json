Because of how little RNA is present in a viral genome, the virus community in tens to thousands of liters of seawater must be isolated and concentrated before one can proceed with shotgun library construction. Other chapters in this book (Wommack et al. 2010, this volume; Steward and Culley 2010, this volume) discuss approaches to concentrating viral communities from seawater. <br \/><br \/>RP-SISPA will not discriminate between viral and non-viral nucleic acids, and it is therefore critical that only pure viral RNA is present as template. We have found that purification through two sequential cesium chloride gradients (Protocol B in Lawrence and Steward 2010, this volume) is effective for removing contaminating cellular and exogenous nucleic acids prior to library construction.<br \/><br \/><strong>Table 1: RT and PCR primer details<\/strong><br \/><br \/>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Name<\/td>\n<td>Sequence (5'-3')<\/td>\n<td>\u00b0C annealing<\/td>\n<td>~Product (bp)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.sc1F<\/td>\n<td>TIGCIGGWGAYTWYARM<\/td>\n<td>50<\/td>\n<td>500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.sc1R<\/td>\n<td>YTCCTTWTCRGSCATKGTA<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.sc2F<\/td>\n<td>ITWGCIGGIGATTWCA<\/td>\n<td>43<\/td>\n<td>500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.sc2R<\/td>\n<td>CKYTTCARRAAWTCAGCATC<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.sc3F<\/td>\n<td>TIATIGMKGGIGAYTA<\/td>\n<td>49<\/td>\n<td>500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.sc3R<\/td>\n<td>TTMARGAAIKMAGCATCTT<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.cdhF<\/td>\n<td>GMIGGTGAYTAYAGCGCTTWYGAY<\/td>\n<td>44<\/td>\n<td>500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mpl.cdhR<\/td>\n<td>ATACCCAATGCCTYTTIARRAA<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RdRp1<\/td>\n<td>GGRGAYTACASCIRWTTTGAT<\/td>\n<td>50<\/td>\n<td>450<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RdRp2<\/td>\n<td>MACCCAACKMCKCTTSARRAA<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SL1<\/td>\n<td>CAGTCCAGTTACGCTGGAGTC<\/td>\n<td>50<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SR2<\/td>\n<td>GGTCAGGTATGATTTAAATGGTCAGT<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FR26RV-N<\/td>\n<td>GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FR40RV-T<\/td>\n<td>GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC(T)20<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FR20RV<\/td>\n<td>GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC<\/td>\n<td>65<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">NA, not applicable<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<br \/><br \/><img id=\"s-mce-img\" class=\"s-mce-img\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bbfc2w6.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/pr-journal\/bbec2w6.jpg\" data-ofn=\"fig1.jpg\" \/><br \/><br \/><strong>Figure 1.<\/strong> RP-SISPA Schematic. This figure is based on Djikeng et al. (2008). Figure 1A shows the three primers used in RP-SISPA. FR26RV-N is composed of the 20 bp 5\u2032 primer sequence, FR20RV (black bar), and a random hexamer at the 3\u2032 end (light blue bar). Primer FR40RV-T is a composite of the FR20RV primer (black bar) and a 20 bp poly T tail (red bar). FR20RV (black bar) is used in PCR. The reverse complement of FR26RV-N (green and orange bar) and FR40RV-T (green and yellow bar) are shown. In Figure 1B, cDNA is synthesized from viral RNA (gray segmented line) with reverse transcriptase primed with FR26RV-N and FR40RV-T. To synthesize the second strand, FR26RV-N is annealed to the newly synthesized cDNA strand where it primes Klenow exo \u2013 DNA polymerase \u201cgap filling\u201d activity, resulting in an FR20RV site on both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. The DNA templates, which represent random stretches of the initial viral RNA genomes, are then amplified with the FR20RV primer to generate more material for cloning and sequencing.","status_id":"1","is_research":"1","status_info":null,"steps":[{"id":"132516","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"10F6C804257B4FFAB9B1165017E5BDA2","previous_guid":null,"previous_id":"0","last_modified":"1449558697","components":[{"component_id":"129596","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"D431AB298A1245C285768B87215E7A85","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"Cesium chloride gradient is conducted to purify viruses from viral concentrate of seawater as described in others chapters of this book (Wommack et al. 2010, this volume;

An illuminator with blue light-emitting bulbs is ideal for gel visualization. If this is not available, take steps to reduce the exposure of the gel to ultraviolet irradiation during excision as much as possible. To mitigate the biases associated with high cycle number PCR, we recommend pooling the products from multiple PCR reactions using the same ds cDNA template.","is_private":"0","public_protocol":"1","can_edit":0,"can_delete":"0","show_name":"0","created_date":"1441819455","created_on":"1441819455","modified_on":"1441819455","last_updated":"1441819455","profile_image":"\/img\/avatars\/001.png","full_name":"Xu Zhong","affiliation":null,"username":"xu-zhong","email":"kevinzhong2006@gmail.com","pa_useranme":"xu-zhong","comments":[]},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"132537","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"FD6A799B07A44583B17F663E5AB9166C","previous_guid":"A228028CD8B2416783906EB62DE8092C","previous_id":"132536","last_modified":"1446607735","components":[{"component_id":"129661","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"2067D3C1DBF0463F9DB276AA4D246691","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"If the sample is to be cloned for Sanger sequencing, we recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 \u00b5L nuclease-free water in preparation for the PCRTerminator (Lucigen) end repair reaction.","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"If the sample is to be cloned for Sanger sequencing, we recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 \u00b5L nuclease-free water in preparation for the PCRTerminator (Lucigen) end repair reaction."},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"129662","previous_id":"129661","original_id":"0","guid":"5F52B1E46E584599997D6A4E91A0337C","previous_guid":"2067D3C1DBF0463F9DB276AA4D246691","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"PCR","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"PCR"},"is_project":0}]},{"id":"132538","is_changed":"0","original_id":"0","is_skipped":"0","is_checked":"0","guid":"D4C84F38E3654193A4013C80B56DBC55","previous_guid":"FD6A799B07A44583B17F663E5AB9166C","previous_id":"132537","last_modified":"1446607735","components":[{"component_id":"129663","previous_id":0,"original_id":"0","guid":"123B856343D24C3BB54522AEB7D814C8","previous_guid":null,"component_type_id":"1","data_id":"0","data":"For the cloning protocol, please refer to the \u201cCloning and sequencing\u201d section of \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/A-degenerate-primer-reverse-transcriptionpolymeras-dse6bd?guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction\u2013based protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses<\/a>\".","order_id":"0","name":"Description","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"1","source_data":{"description":"For the cloning protocol, please refer to the \u201cCloning and sequencing\u201d section of \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/A-degenerate-primer-reverse-transcriptionpolymeras-dse6bd?guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction\u2013based protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses<\/a>\"."},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"129664","previous_id":"129663","original_id":"0","guid":"7246BD98CE384CB48AA1DF5BF04E3A59","previous_guid":"123B856343D24C3BB54522AEB7D814C8","component_type_id":"6","data_id":"0","data":"PCR","order_id":"1","name":"Section","data_by_id":"0","type_id":"6","source_data":{"section":"PCR"},"is_project":0},{"component_id":"129665","previous_id":"129664","original_id":"0","guid":"13A9D3D8B8DE420A83E8E71EDE5C1FEF","previous_guid":"7246BD98CE384CB48AA1DF5BF04E3A59","component_type_id":"26","data_id":"8853","data":"","order_id":"2","name":"Note","data_by_id":"1","type_id":"26","source_data":{"annotation_id":"8853","thread_id":"8853","id":"8853","thread_title":"Annotation on step 24 of Construction of shotgun libraries from RNA virus assemblages","uri":"annotation-on-step-24-of-construction-of-shotgun-libraries","thread_uri":"annotation-on-step-24-of-construction-of-shotgun-libraries","step_id":"132538","protocol_uri":"Construction-of-shotgun-libraries-from-RNA-virus-a-dsi6cd","protocol_name":"Construction of shotgun libraries from RNA virus assemblages","protocol_name_html":"Construction of shotgun libraries from RNA virus assemblages","annotation":"The procedure from this point forward is the same.
