Alternatively, for gemmules that are more embedded in the host skeleton, sterile teasing needles or fine forceps can be used to carefully dissect the gemmules away from the skeleton under a compound microscope with the Petri dish sitting on ice. There may be gemmules that do not contain cells (non viable) and those should be discarded. Novices might try bursting a few gemmules with fine forceps to develop an ability to differentiate between viable and non viable gemmules. <\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/protocols-files.s3.amazonaws.com\/private\/5debe8882d7c12457191efe3a00b8baa1bfbe228d4b7aceb03daf5d8ec4aa760\/btvw9z4e.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYFAX46LHRVQMGOA%2F20191109%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191109T140652Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-Signature=a37d4a0d4c9cb3e3eefd0b72c0dbcb6ce5b01a95bea8a73b504045f4604e99d6\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"48448CBBE34C42768D684DCE3001FA4A","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/protocols-files.s3.amazonaws.com\/private\/5debe8882d7c12457191efe3a00b8baa1bfbe228d4b7aceb03daf5d8ec4aa760\/btvw9z4e.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYFAX46LHRVQMGOA%2F20191109%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191109T140652Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-Signature=a37d4a0d4c9cb3e3eefd0b72c0dbcb6ce5b01a95bea8a73b504045f4604e99d6\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":845350,"guid":"DF9DC61004A711EAA857A9E9053F0A38","previous_id":845348,"previous_guid":"9845760004A711EAA857A9E9053F0A38","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"3EA49B7214124CDAAD8B9A7760B2E4EE","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Cleaning and hatching sponge gemmules "}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"A42567468B9D42809FFEC9287FA3E4BF","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Transfer freed gemmules from the Petri dish to a deeper glass bowl filled with ice cold distilled water.

Many species produce an asexual cyst called a gemmule that contains stem cells which allow the sponge to survive harsh periods in a dormant state. For over a century gemmules from freshwater sponges have been collected to grow sponges in controlled laboratory conditions for research and teaching. The practicality of this method of culturing sponges has led to a rich literature on the physiology, cell and developmental biology of freshwater sponges. A few species have gemmules that withstand extreme cold. The freshwater sponge <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Ephydatia muelleri<\/span><span> can be frozen at -80\u00b0C and hatched with good success even several years later. A high quality assembly of the genome of this species makes this an especially attractive tool for a wide range of studies. While there are many publications reporting hatching of freshwater sponges, there is no universally available protocol, especially for freezing and thawing this species. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Here we outline a protocol for cleaning and hatching gemmules from freshwater sponges and for freezing gemmules for storage at -80C and subsequently thawing frozen gemmules to grow sponges. Sponge gemmules can be collected during late fall and winter months and kept in water at ~3 degrees Celcius for many months prior to cleaning and hatching, but it is recommended that the water is aerated and exchanged for new ice-cold water every few weeks. The best hatching rate is found with gemmules cleaned within the first 6 months of collection. Hatching success varies with population of sponges. Once cleaned, gemmules can be kept in the fridge (below 6 degrees Celcius) and hatched as needed for several weeks. Cleaned gemmules have a greater tendency to hatch earlier than gemmules left in the native sponge skeleton, but even gemmules left\u00a0below 6 degrees Celcius in the native sponge skeleton can often hatch after washing months later. For best hatching success, gemmules frozen at -80C should be no older than 4-6 weeks. Gemmules frozen at -80C tend to take slightly longer to hatch, but all aspects of sponge development are identical to those in sponges hatched from freshly collected gemmules. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1573597340}
