The first trial was done following the Sartorius user manual steps explicitly for 8 L filtered on a Vivaflow 200 device, but resulted in about 25% phage recovery. The second trial incorporated modifications which enhanced recovery to nearly 100% from 4 L of lysate using a Vivaflow 200 device and 2 L of lysate using a Vivaflow 50 device, and is described in this protocol for the Vivaflow 50.
